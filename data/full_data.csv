25,"Throwaway coz I don’t want it connected to my main. 
My sister and I (both mid-20sF, I’m a few years older) share a house together. It was our parents house and we both inherited it after they died. We have equal share/ownership of the house. 
The house has four bedrooms, one is the master room and has an ensuite and walk in wardrobe, the others three just have built-in robes. 
When we both moved back in after deciding that neither of us wanted to sell, we agreed that she could have the master suite, but the two largest of the other bedrooms would both be mine. One as an actual bedroom and the other as a gaming room for me. The last and smallest bedroom is a guest room.

Her boyfriend’s been living here for a while and she recently told me that she’s pregnant. I’m not particularly looking forward to sharing a house with a screaming baby, but it’s her house too and she has every right to be here and raise her kid. 

Obviously, they baby will need a bedroom, and I was expecting that to be the guest room. It is the smallest bedroom in the house, but it’s still the same size as a standard bedroom. But my sister wouldn’t go for that. She’s insisting I move my stuff out of my games room so that can be that baby’s room. I told her that I’m not moving my stuff into the guest room, because that wasn’t our agreement, but then she informed me that actually, I won’t be able to do that either, as we would still need a guest room, especially with the baby coming as her bf’s family will want to visit. 

So I said fine, you can have my games room, if you move into my room and give me the master room. She started crying and said that as a mother, she’s going to need her own space and she deserves the master bedroom. I asked what she expected me to do, and she said I should just suck it up and keep ‘all my crap’ in my own room. 

We’re at an impasse and I can’t get her to come to a real agreement with me. She keeps calling me a ‘huge bitch’ and says that I should let her have both the master bedroom and my gaming room because she ‘needs them more’ her boyfriend says I should just deal with it, that because I don’t want kids anyway, I should just let suck it up. My girlfriend, who also spends a lot of time here, is on my side and says my sister is being a spoiled entitled little brat.

26,"I want to preface this by saying that I am aware this is a very privileged issue but I’m trying to get some perspective on my opinion. 

My husband and I have 3 kids that are 10 months, 3 years and 6 years old. My husband has a high profile job and it means he’s gone often. I work a regular 9-5. We originally used daycare for our oldest but my middle was born right when the pandemic began, so we hired a nanny. She originally worked when I did. But by the time baby came around, I was very overwhelmed doing bath and bedtime on my own, on top of developing postpartum depression. After a breakdown, we spoke with the nanny and she agreed to adjust her hours so she’s helping me with dinner, bath and bed. 

We’ve gotten close over the past 6 months doing this. In many ways, she’s become like a third parent to the kids. She’s so good with them. We’ve created a routine that works well. I tend to the baby during bath and bed, she handles the older 2.  It’s a nice rhythm and my mental health has gotten so much better.

My husband isn’t traveling all the time but most nights, he isn’t even home for dinner and bed. He will help me weekends he’s home. But because he’s gone so often, he’s reluctant to be firm with the kids.

There are times he’s come home when our nanny is there. He tries to help her with bath and bed, but allows the boys to rough house, lets them break the routine and it seriously throws them off and delays bedtime.

My nanny shared with me she feels awkward. Obviously she doesn’t want to undermine her employer but it just makes her job harder. But my husband also doesn’t want her to go home when he arrives as he says he can’t handle it alone. 

I told him if that’s the case, then he needs to defer to the nanny and follow her lead. She knows our boys best and she has to deal with the aftermath when they don’t listen and give her a hard time.

My husband feels that she’s just an employee and he’s the dad. His salary does pay for her. However, I don’t feel this is fair to her.

I told him he either follows her lead for bed and bath or he doesn’t help at all. He told me I’m allowing the nanny to take over and replace him. AITA?",1,2,,3,,,,
27,"My mom is getting remarried (my birth father passed away a while ago). A few weeks ago I won Taylor Swift tickets on the radio for the same day as her wedding. I made the decision to go to the concert over the wedding, and I told her this, and she is very upset- she has not spoken to me since. I love my mother and feel bad missing her wedding, but I thought she would understand due to the circumstances. I do not like my soon-to-be stepfather, and I feel like seeing Taylor Swift is a once in a lifetime experience that I do not want to miss. 

UPDATE: I have made it very clear to my mom over the past few months that I am not okay with the marriage, but still plan to be at the wedding. But then I won the tickets, and things changed. 

So, AITA for choosing the concert over the wedding?",3,2,,4,,,,
28,"Me: [39M], my wife [37F], my sister [43F]

My sister has her wedding coming up. She was a full-time nurse in the armed forces from 2002-2012 and after she left the service she got a job as a surgical/operating room nurse. The hospital she works does not allow anyone (doctors, nurses etc) to wear makeup in the operating room. There are other rules like no nail polish or perfume too but makeup is the big one. Something about keeping the environment sterile. My sister said she isn't going to wear makeup on her wedding day. My wife offered to teach her or to do some light makeup on the day but my sister said no. She said she hasn't worn or owned makeup since she joined the armed forces and so she does not think she needs it for her wedding. 

I think my wife is right. Also my wife was pretty hurt when my sister said no. My wife pointed out that she might look washed out in the photos but my sister just said that besides her friend, our mom and my wife no one else at the wedding will be wearing makeup. Her fiancé, he isn't so she does not think she needs it. I think my wife is right and that my sister will regret it after the fact. My sister thinks we are wrong and it's causing friction between her and I now. I just don't want her to regret it later. She doesn't deserve that. Plus my wife is still hurt.",2,2,,4,,,,
29,"This coming Sunday will be my first mother's day as a mom, after 3 years of infertility and multiple miscarriages. I think my history may be clouding my judgement here and making me selfish but, at the same time, I'm having a hard time seeing how I'm wrong. I'm hoping you guys can give me some clarity.

All I want to do for mother's day is spend the day with my husband and baby and go for a nice lunch at my favorite restaurant. This has apparently pissed everyone off. My mother wants us to drive 1.5 hours to spend mother's day with her. I really don't want to spend 3 hours in a car with a five month old in one day. My MIL wants us to have lunch with her before she goes and has dinner with her mother. My husband says we have to see his mother on mother's day and, while he's annoyed that she is only available to see us for lunch, says we will have to plan the day around her availability. She does not want to go to the restaurant that I want to go to, and we can't go to that restaurant for dinner because of the baby's bedtime.

Maybe I'm being selfish but I feel like this is my first mother's day and we should do what I want and everyone else can suck it up. My husband thinks I need to compromise and that we can have a perfectly nice lunch that celebrates both me and his mom somewhere that we both like. My mom is upset that no version of our mother's day plans involve her. 

I finally broke down and told everyone that I will be going to my favorite restaurant with the baby and that they can all go do whatever they want. Everyone is calling me selfish and overdramatic. AITA?",2,1,,1,,,,
30,"Not only did my ex move to another state to be with another man, but she also completely ghosted me.

While we were together, I would help her elderly parents out with things around the house that needed to be fixed. Handyman stuff. Her parents were always very nice to me and I continued to help them after she bounced. I made an agreement with her parents that I would never ask anything about her, nor that I be told about anything going on in her life. I also didn't want them to tell her about anything going on in my life or that I was continuing to help them with things.

2 years have gone by and I've fixed leaky sinks, taken care of various things around the house and, when it snows, I'm always there to shovel. (Corner hose. 'Nuff said.)

A few months ago, I agreed to install a new faucet on 1 of their sinks. The faucet they purchased had the wrong connecters to coneect to the existing copper piping so I wasn't able to install it right away. The 1st time I came back, I'd purchased adapters to mount it and the adapters had the wrong threading. After another week or so, I came back with more adapters only to find out that they were straight thread and not pipe thread. So they leaked at the joint.

Unable to get the proper adapters, I'd gotten a little frustrated. Then some personal matters came up and I put the sink on the backburner. (Just to be clear: Every time I failed an attempt to mount the new faucet, I would remount the original. So I never left them without a functioning sink.)

The other day, a friend let me know that there was a post directed to me on 1 of her socials. It was a rant about how I shouldn't promise to do things for her elderly parents, if I wasn't going to. And that I wasn't hurting her by hurting them. Obviously, that meant they were telling their daughter that I'd been helping them. The main reason for the agreement was to facilitate cutting ties with their daughter. I didn't want to be accused of trying to stay in her life or trying to keep tabs on her. I was helping her parents because they're good people that need the help.

As a result of whatever they were telling her about me, not only did that give her an excuse to blast about me on social media, but also, she managed to skew it into a belief that I wasn't helping her parents as a way to get back at her.

So, to me, I did the only logical thing: I went over to her parents house and reminded them of our agreement. Of how they weren't supposed to mention anything about me to their daughter and that, because of this betrayal, I will no longer be available to help them with anything around the house.

I was polite &amp; cordial about it. But still have a bad taste in my mouth. After I had left, her mother sent me a series of text messages, apologizing. Telling me that I was one of the only people they trusted to come into their home and fix anything. Am I going too far by walking away from them?",1,1,,1,,,,
31,"**I meant to put half sister in the title, not step sister
 

My husband has a daughter from a previous relationship, “Maddie” (15F). Before I even met my husband, Maddie’s mother moved abroad. Maddie decided to go with her. My husband and I been married for 10 years and we have a 8 year old daughter “Abby”. Maddie visits us for the whole summer and 2 weeks in the winter. We go to her when Abby is on spring break. 

We obviously save big family trips for when Maddie is with us. Same with any other “once in a lifetime” events. However, my husband is consistently reluctant to do pretty much anything without Maddie. I tried to be patient, but it feels like we can’t do anything throughout the year until she gets there. 

An example, we live near a water park. We have season passes and take Maddie all throughout the summer. But my husband refuses to go until Maddie comes to stay with us. And he doesn’t want Abby to go as it’s unfair. I’ve tried discussing this with him but he won’t budge. Sometimes I win him over but then he complains the entire time that Maddie isn’t there. 

Abby loves Taylor Swift, who was going to be in the area for a limited time and before Maddie would arrive. My mom somehow scored us tickets and Abby was so excited. My husband said it wasn’t fair because Maddie also loves Taylor Swift and she doesn’t get to go. I said I’d take both girls to another concert during the summer, as there’s going to be a few other artists that I know Maddie likes in the area. My husband said it still isn’t fair and tried to ban Abby from going. (Because I know it will be asked, it’s not possible for Maddie to fly out for the concert. She still has school and important exams that can’t be missed.)

I put my foot down and said that life isn’t always going to be fair. Maddie lives in another country. She is going to miss out on things. It’s not fair to ask Abby to give up fun opportunities because Maddie can’t come. I pointed out that Maddie gets to do fun things with her mom and Abby isn’t there (which I think is completely fair). My husband said that’s different, because his ex isn’t Abby’s mom, but he’s Maddie’s dad.

Eventually, he could see I wasn’t going to give up and said yes to the concert. My mom, Abby and I attended and we had a great time. It was Abby’s first concert and she loved it. 

My husband says I bullied him into this and that if Maddie didn’t get to go, Abby shouldn’t. Maddie is disappointed she didn’t get to go but seems happy for her sister.

32,"My wife (37F) and I (38M) moved to a new neighborhood about 3 years ago with our 2 kids (8 &amp; 6).  Our neighbors across the street have 2 kids (9 &amp; 7) that our kids quickly became friends with. We would hang out with the parents as well and my wife became close friends with the mom.   
 The dad and I got along fine, but never got as close as my wife and the mother. 

Unfortunately, about a year ago, the parents separated and the mom filed for divorce.  Apparently, the dad had an affair.  The mom moved out as the house was owned by the dad before they got married.  She took the kids with her.  According to my wife, the mom tried to get full custody of the kids, but the dad asked for and was granted partial custody.  So he has the kids 3 weekends a month, the rest of the time they stay with their mom.  I've only very briefly talked with the dad about the whole thing as he obviously feels a lot of shame about the affair and we aren't close enough for me to feel I can ask deep questions about it.

The kids all still play together when they can.  I noticed my wife would make it a point to make sure our kids invited them over to our house.  I also noticed that my wife was asking the neighbor kids some pretty odd and honestly rather intrusive questions about their dad.  Like if he has ""friends"" over at his house when they are there.  What he feeds them, what rules he has at home, do they feel safe there, etc.  

This past weekend the kids were at our house and stayed over for dinner and my wife asked the kids if they like hanging out with their dad or mom more.  I cut in before the kids could answer and changed the subject to watching a movie after dinner.  As my wife and I were cleaning up, I asked her what the hell all the questions are about.

She said that her friend is still trying to get full custody of their kids and she asked my wife if she would keep an eye out for anything that she could use to build the case against the dad.  I was shocked.  I told her that's none of our business and she needs to stay out of it.  I told her it seems like her friend is still upset about the affair and is using that anger as justification to try and take the kids away from their father.  

I told her that neither of us has ever seen a single thing to indicate that this guy is a bad father. Sure, he had an affair and that makes him a bad husband, but that has zero influence on his ability to be a good loving father.  I told her what her friend asked to do her was gross and the fact that she's going along with it is something that I strongly disagree with.  I told her she needs to mind her own business.

She said she's just trying to look out for her friend and she's trying to make sure that the kids end up in a situation that is best for them.  I told her that essentially spying on our neighbor is not her responsibility and she's definitely in the wrong for asking the kids the kind of questions she is.  She feels she's completely justified, but I do not.",1,1,,3,,,,
33,"My (26f) brother Mike (29) recently moved near me because of work. We are now half an hour away from each other. We were 4-5 hours away most of our adult lives and usually only saw each other during Christmas at our parents’. Mike is living with his fiancée Sara (30f) and her daughter from a previous relationship Eve (6). Sara works from home as a freelancer.

Ever since the move I went to hang out at Mike’s a lot because I miss him. Sara and I got along OK, but Eve was attached to me from the start. She said I look like one of the princess dolls she has. Thus our friendship is born.

One of the activities Eve and I enjoy is styling our hair. Our hair is very similar: long, blonde, fine and super straight. We enjoy braiding, curling and ornamenting our locks, as Sara has had short hair all her life and cannot style her daughter’s hair beyond a simple ponytail. Eve loved it when I put our hair in matching styles and we often went to dinner like that. My brother and Sara thought it was adorable.

A few days ago an incident at school caused Eve’s hair to be damaged. Sara took her to the salon but the best they could do was cut and trim her hair to just above shoulder’s length. Eve was crying and really upset; she said she won’t get to play hair styling and have matching hair with me anymore since her hair is short now. She said it’s not fair that I will be the only princess in the family now. 

Sara called me and asked if I can cut my hair to match with Eve so she wouldn’t be sad. She said it will be a nice change of pace and our hair will grow back. 

I told her no. A trim of an inch is one thing but shoulder length is too short for my liking. Sara said I’m not being considerate as it’ll mean a lot to Eve to know her aunt matches with her. 

Mike said my hair my decision, but my mom said it would be a nice thing to do. I wonder if I’m AH.",2,1,,2,,,,
34,"My best friend had her first baby, my godchild, 4 months back. She had a rough childbirth and was bedridden for several weeks after. Her mom and in laws have moved in with them or close by to help with childcare. But she has been complaining about feeling emotionally neglected and underappreciated. Everyone is focused on the ""precious"" baby and she feels like her only worth is that of the cow that produces its milk. She might be slipping into ppd (undiagnosed). Her husband helps a bit with childcare but it's a flip of a coin if he'll show up for her emotionally. For the most part he hasn't. He just doesn't get what she has been through and is going through. 

This weekend, I ordered a mother's day self care package for my mom and had an extra one shipped to my friend. I added a gift note thanking her for giving me the world's cutest godchild and for everything she has done for us. It was meant to be a gift from me - her friend - to celebrate her new journey as a mom. 

The gift was delivered early. She was very happy to receive it. She knew it was from me. 

But here's the problem - the gift box apparently had a message printed on it from a child to its mother (thank you mom or I love you mom or something similar). Her husband saw it and texted me telling me it was not cool that I bought a gift for his wife on his child's behalf without consulting him. Buying a gift on his baby's behalf was his right. I clarified that the gift was from me, and this was not a competition. He could get her gifts on his behalf and on the baby's behalf on Sunday. 

And I said I hadn't zoomed in on the picture of the box to read the message printed on it when I was ordering it online. But he wasn't having it. He said it was an asshole move meant to undercut him. So AITA?

35,"Throwaway account.

Ok so I'm upset and confused and I told Sister/BIL I would post here to settle this argument, so they will be seeing and reading this.

For those who don't know Neopets is a virtual pet game site that was really popular around the late 90s/early 2000s. It kind of died a bit for a while but has recently started to get popular again. I have been playing for years. My account is 18 years old and it has the stats to reflect that (pets/avatars/stamps/gallery/trophies etc.). If you don't play it may not mean alot and not to brag but I have a rather impressive account due to the fact I have been playing so long.

I 34F have no kids (not childfree, just don't have any). My sister 32F and BIL 34M have a daughter 11F who has been very sickly all her life. I'll not go into exactly what is wrong with her but she's been in and out of hospitals alot in her young life and recently had to go back in again for a few weeks. :(

I recently learned that she's been playing on [Neopets.com](https://Neopets.com) for a few months to help pass the time when she's not feeling well. She's really gotten into it and from what my sister says talks about it alot. She was excited to learn I also play and we talked about it when I visited her. I looked up her account and gifted her a bunch of stuff, expensive stuff that would be hard for a newer account to get. (In-game stuff using In-game money which can be kind of hard to earn in large amounts).

Anyway, long story short she asked how I can afford the stuff I sent her (it was worth millions of NP) and how I have all the stuff my account has. I explained I had been playing for 18 years, did every plot/event etc. Well, apparently she got upset at the huge difference between our two accounts and asked for more stuff. When I told her no she started crying to my sister and BIL about it. My BIL came over and asked if I could gift my account to niece for her upcoming birthday (which she has to spend in the hospital). Said it would mean to world to her. I said no. I've had this account since before she was born, before we even met my BIL. I don't want to get rid of it. I still play on it literally everyday.

Well he got mad and tried guilt-tripping me. I'm an adult and she's a child and it would make her happy in a rough time in her life. I'm happy to help her learn the tricks and trades of the game but I'm not giving away my account. He tried to buy it off me but I still said no. Now he is super pissed and got my sister and parents on their side. I'm being hounded everyday for this and being called an asshole because it's all my niece will talk about and she really really wants it. I feel bad because she's just a little girl in the hospital and guilty for not giving it. I offered to send a bunch of stuff to her account again but she wants my stats so she's not treated like such a newbie who doesn't know anything by other players too.

I feel guilty for this but I want to keep my account. AITA?

I promise I'm reading all of them and I'm making sure my family has the link so they can read them too. Hopefully we can have a civil conversation about it after reading all this.

36,"So, I (20F) don't have siblings, younger/baby cousins and overall never dealt closely with babies before, just in those brief moments like when you're in line and there's someone with a baby before you and the baby smiles at you.

The thing situation is: after my therapy session was over, I went to the waiting room to wait for a lift, and there was a huge family there. Like grandparents, sisters, aunt. The man who seemed to be the grandfather was taking care of a baby who I presumed doesn't have barely 6 months. Then the baby started to cry and her mother suddenly appeared and stated that she needed a diaper change. She asked for the aunt of the baby to fetch a bag with baby stuff and proceeded to simply lay the child down in one of the couches where a guy who didn't seem like part of the family was sat. He even said something in surprise, since the woman didn't say anything and just laid the baby there and started to take the diaper off. 

Given the situation and the awkwardness, and since they were new to the clinic, I pointed out that there was a bathroom right at the end of the room in case the mother wanted more privacy and tranquility to change her baby, especially because the little girl didn't stop crying and the random dude had to sort of hold her so she didn't roll out of the couch. When I said that, the woman shot me a very pissed off, angry look and said very curtly that ""I should know better that there wasn't any diapers changer there"". I fell quiet and every family member of hers looked at me like I've said the most offensive thing ever. Luckily, my mother came to pick me up right after that.

When I told her that, she laughed and said I should've kept quiet because the mother probably misunderstood it as me being bothered by it. I replied that I said it in the calmest tone possible (which is true), but my mother still said that it was kind of a jerk move from my part, and now I'm stuck thinking about this. AITA?

EDIT 1: I don't know if it's relevant, but the family's car was parked just in front of the clinic, and it was a huge SUV. The aunt went to the car to fetch the baby's bag and I could see it from the window. The baby even was in her baby comfort/bebe confort. Her stuff bag was so full I thought it had a changing mat in it because it'd sure fit one. I also thought the mother could change the baby in the baby comfort, so even if she didn't have the mat, she could maybe bring the baby to the WC and change her in the comfort. I didn't know that according to the baby's age, you have to lie them down to change them.

EDIT 2: The WC's counter has a huge surface area. It is both wide and long, so I believe it could easily fit the baby since she wasn't big. The counter is never wet too, even around the sink. And they always keep tons of toilette paper there.",1,2,,2,,,,
37,"My girlfriend and I (both lesbians in our early 30s) were having dinner with a group of her friends (10 people and my GF and I making 12) most of whom were also queer but two of whom were straight, but partners of queer people there. We were just talking about mostly silly stuff we had seen in the news, and one of her friends, Amber, brought up the angry guy on the plane cursing about the crying baby. 

I was kinda surprised when several people took the man's side and started saying, what in my opinion, was some pretty unhinged stuff. Not just ""I don't like kids"" but more than that, like they genuinely talked like they hated kids. This went on for a while, to the point that they were ranting about how kids ruin everything and that there should be more kid-free zones and they shouldn't be out in public and that parents shouldn't force other people to be around them. 

I've heard that stuff online, but I didn't think anyone would ever actually talk like that in real life. After about 10 minutes, I said that being so anti-child (to the point of declaring hate) was not really any different from homophobia, something that basically everyone in the room has experienced, and that hating anyone for merely existing was wrong. Another friend, David, jumped in and said that it was different and that kids weren't actually persecuted. I told him he had literally just said, in all seriousness, that kids shouldn't be allowed on airplanes or into restaurants - that that is, in fact, a call for persecution. I also said that kids have very few rights and should be a protected class, and things got very heated. Eventually, my GF stormed out and I let with her and the whole car ride home she told me I was an AH, all her friends now think I'm an AH, and that I myself was being homophobic for what I said.

I guess I can see how I am the AH for ruining the dinner, but I am not sure?",2,1,,1,,,,
38,"I worked my ass off over the last three years to lose 120 lbs, and I look and feel amazing. I have been obese for almost my whole childhood and all of my adulthood, and it feels almost like life has finally begun.

I posted my before and after to Facebook because I'm a dinosaur at heart, and got a message shortly after from ""Len,"" my friend's girlfriend. Len is over 300 lbs, which...I mean, I don't recommend it, but if that's your choice then whatever. She's also claims that she's an atypical anorexic who gains weight because she only eats 500 calories a day. That is blatantly not true, but not my circus/monkeys.

Len said that it was very inappropriate to post a weight loss before/after without a warning because it could cause a relapse in people with EDs, and that if I absolutely had to post it I should make it an album with a black cover photo and a warning so that people would have to click through to see the actual photo. The message also contained a long and unscientific rant about my personal choices that is not super relevant here, but didn't do much to get me in the mood to make these accommodations. So I told her that I was going to go ahead and post whatever I wanted to my own personal Facebook, and if she didn't like seeing it she should probably go ahead and unfollow me.

I guess that was a declaration of war because she absolutely blew up at me and dragged her gf/my friend into the mix, along with some other mutual friends, and it's a big chaos of ""It's no big deal to just hide the photo, [me]"" vs. ""It's no big deal to just unfollow her, Len.""",1,,1,1,,,,
39,"So this happened last week and my girlfriend and I haven’t really been getting along at all since and I just wanted an unbiased opinion.

I (26M) have been dating Ella (22F) for two months now. My family is from an Asian background so a majority of the food I cook for just myself include peanuts and other nuts because it’s an important ingredient in my cultural dishes. I live alone, so I just make my own food for myself, but because of Ella’s allergy, I don’t make foods with peanuts in them when I know I’m also cooking for her.

Her allergy is only reactive if she ingests a good amount of the actual nut and is unaffected by smell, airborne, and small traces of cross contamination. Recently, I made a dish which contains a heavy usage of nuts blended into the curry so you can’t see that they’re there and left the leftovers in my fridge. Ella came over while I was in the shower, and during that time she apparently went into my fridge and helped herself to a big portion of the curry and immediately started having an allergic reaction. Luckily she had her epipen and was okay after a few minutes, but she absolutely went off on me and kept accusing me of causing her harm.

I felt extremely guilty that she had a bad allergic reaction from my food and apologized profusely and offered to take her to the hospital, but she was just screaming at me the whole time. She said that if I really cared about her I should have labeled all of my food for her and let her know ahead of time exactly what in the fridge has nuts. I understand that this is extremely scary and important for her health, but the same time she 1) never asked me to label things before 2) went into my fridge and helped herself to my food without even asking me 3) got mad at me for cooking my cultural dishes at all because they have her allergen in them.

I told her that going forward, I’ll try to put a sticky note on the containers that have nuts in the food so this doesn’t happen again, but that she also cannot blame me for her allergic reaction when she ate my food without even asking me if she could or what was in it. AITA?",1,,2,1,,,,
40,"I like to bake and make desserts as a hobby. Because I do so frequently I like to get the nicest ingredients I can.

So I buy nice chocolate, vanilla paste from a wholesaler, French butter and flakey salt etc., and I try to buy local honey and jams where possible.

So the ingredients are a little pricier than if you just got what you needed at the supermarket.

When I get the chocolate or vanilla or butter (basically anything that I would purchase in a bulk amount) I give some to my mum so she has it too.

I guess my SIL tried something mum made and then tried to recreate it and thought it didn’t taste the same. Mum told her I get her special ingredients. SIL messaged me asking about it so I sent her a list of where I buy my stuff.

She replied back that I could just include her when I next gave some to my mum. (As in she wanted the stuff for free.)

I said I wasn’t comfortable doing that as I would have to pay more to get extra.

Now her and my brother are pissed off at me because apparently I’m excluding her from a family thing and making her feel isolated",1,,1,1,,,,
41,"(Fake names for anonymity)

My sister-in-law “Fae” and brother “Max” had recently struggled to afford their rent, as it went up. They received the standard 90 day notice from their landlady, but still struggled to keep up with the rent due to not spending responsibly.

Fae and Max asked me if I could help them financially. I respectfully told them no. (If they had been in debt because something unavoidable drained their savings (like medical expenses) I would have taken from my own savings. But that isn’t what happened here.)

Fae and Max decided to sell one of their cars. Max has to take the bus to work on certain mornings now. But they are now fully caught up with their rent payments and have become more responsible with their spending.

I have a close friend “Jim” with two young daughters. His youngest’s crib used to be in he and his wife’s room, but now she is too old for the crib and will be sharing a room with her sister.

Jim casually mentioned this to me, and that he felt bad, since having two normal beds in that room would be tight. I had a bunk bed that I used to share with a roommate. It’s just been sitting around in storage, so I offered it to Jim for free as long as he helped me move it.

My parents recently moved into a new house and held a small housewarming party. Jim and his wife attended as well, as we’ve been friends for years and consider each other family. During the party, Jim brought his daughters up to me to “Thank auntie OP for giving us your bunk bed.”

Fae happened to be in the dining room as well when that happened. She and Max came up to me after the other guests left and said they were disappointed that I had given the bunk bed to Jim when I could have easily sold it to help them with their rent situation.

Fae and Max acknowledged that I had no technical obligation to help with their rent. But said it was about morals and that since I was choosing to be generous, I should have prioritized actual family over Jim.

My father wanted me to apologize to Fae and Max, since I could have easily gotten two or three hundred for the bunk bed and that would have helped them a lot before they had to sell one of their cars. My mother told me not to, because Fae and Max are responsible for themselves and I was allowed to do something generous for Jim.

I still feel bad, since Fae and Max had to sell one of their cars and relying on the bus is inconvenient. I still don’t think that I should have to apologize for doing a generous thing for a friend. But I know I’m biased. Are Fae, Max, and my father right that actual family should have come before a friend?",1,,2,1,,,,
42,"A year ago, I bought what I see as a 26 year old girls dream home. At the same time, my 22 year old sister was graduating college, with no money &amp; no job &amp; needed a place to stay. We agreed that she could move in with me, &amp; after getting a job, would start paying rent until she got back on her feet. She got a job as a substitute teacher but was only making $14/hr. This worked for some time with no issues until about 3 months ago when she hit rock bottom. She informed me that she could no longer afford to pay rent. At the same time, it was her birthday so I told her that I would give her one month free from rent for her birthday. The following month, she was still struggling which I hate to see, so I made a deal that if she didnt pay rent again that she would use the rent money to put towards her debt. She agreed. Now it is month three. 

She recently downloaded Tinder &amp; allowed a random guy into my home to sleep with him. Now, she is pregnant, after not taking her birth control correctly, not wearing a condom, &amp; not making the man pull out. She has told me that she wants to keep the child. I only have one other room as a guest room &amp; she wants to use that room as the nursery. I mentioned having the childs crib in her room as to keep the guest room for family/friends to come stay &amp; help with the child or just if they needed it, but she was very unhappy about this option &amp; did not want to give up her room for the child. Over the last few months I have had tens of thousands of dollars worth of problems arise to include having to get a brand new roof, etc. Now, with all the extra payments I have, on top of my sister no longer being able to pay rent, &amp; a soon to be newborn, I will likely have to sell my house to be able to afford to take care of my sister &amp; her newborn. It is not my job but I dont want to see her fail. I want her to have a stable living situation. My parents live far from us &amp; cannot afford to help, &amp; although the baby daddy wants to be involved, she just met him &amp; knows nothing about him or his living situation. We have a close relationship &amp; I want to support her when she needs it but I am now at risk of having to sell my house &amp; find a new place to live in order to be able to help her. She is not helping herself though by finding a new &amp; higher paying job; she keeps saying she will get to it eventually in regards to getting medical insurance for the baby (she is still under my parents insurance), &amp; much more, which proves she is not ready maturity wise. 

I am at a loss because I dont want to give up my dream home &amp; my life for a mistake that I had no part in but I also never want to see anyone else struggle or have hardships if I can help in some way. I work full time on top of overtime already &amp; have now applied for a weekend/evening serving position to try &amp; make extra money before things tank, but would I be an asshole if I kick her out or force her to pay rent when she doesnt have the money &amp; needs to save before having a baby?",2,,2,1,,,,
43,"Lately, my husband has been waking me up between 1 am. and 3 am. because he is hungry or wants a rub. (Back or arm) I hate being woken up when I am sleeping.  Last time, he woke me up by poking me until I woke up. It's not hard, just insistent. I hate being woken up when I am deep asleep. 

 I told him he needs to not make a habit of it because if he wants a snack in the middle of the night he can get it himself and if he wanted a rub he should have asked before we went to bed. 

He thinks I am the asshole because l don't drive, and he has to wake up to bring me to work every day Monday through Friday at around 7:15 am.  

 I tried to say waking up after 8 full hours is different than being woke up in the middle of the night.   I can usually fall back asleep fast after, but sometimes, like tonight, I have trouble. He said it's because his back hurts etc. He wants a rub to fall back asleep but didn't tell me that until tonight. I also sometimes wake him up snoring. 

AITA for not wanting to wake up in the middle of the night to make him a snack or give him a rub when he has to wake up to take me to work in the morning? 


I feel like I am the asshole  because I didn't know it was because his back hurt and to help him fall back asleep. But at the same time he is a grown man and can get his own midnight snack. 


I can answer questions tomorrow or I guess today since it's now 4 am. Also on mobile so forgive any spelling or grammar issues.


Edit: Thanks, everyone. I am going to keep telling him no. This just started about a week ago, and I didn't do it every time.  last night,  he wanted me to microwave his leftovers at 3 a,  and I did it just so he would stop saying he was hungry. I'm going to stick to telling him no and not do it.

Edit 2: I get panic attacks when I drive. I am thinking of getting lessons at a driving school, but it's hard when they are so expensive, and I am not sure how they would deal with the panic attacks.

Edit 3: he is not a cat. Thanks everyone. I was standing my ground about not doing it and I wanted to make sure I was right. It's good to know so many agree with me. Chances are he will try again and when I say no he will stop. Or will stop now that we had the argument about it. I don't plan on giving in to him being childish about this. I have to get back to work but I appreciate everyone commenting",1,,1,1,,,,
44,"I (18f) have a twin, Mary. We don’t have any more siblings. Mary got pregnant when she was 14. She couldn’t find the father to tell him she was pregnant and he is still nowhere to be seen.

We have lived with our parents in a 2 bedroom apartment for nearly a decade now. So when Mary gave birth, her baby had to stay in our room. My parents worked more so they could provide for the baby so it was mostly Mary and I at home taking care of her baby. If I wasn’t at school, my parents would demand that I go home and help my sister with her baby. I had no life, no privacy and no love or attention since my sister had her baby. I know obviously the baby and mother take priority but I felt so alone. At 14-15, it was very hard for me to come to terms with my parents not asking me how I’m doing anymore, not congratulating me on my achievements, coming to my games, taking care of me when I’m sick etc. I became resentful of Mary and my parents but I did a pretty good job at never showing them that. I knew the feeling would pass and it did by the time I was 16.

I got at a job at 16 so I had some time to myself outside of school and my niece. My parents then coerced me to contribute almost 80% of wages to help Mary take care of her baby. I’ve always been a pushover so I couldn’t say no, especially because Mary and the baby did actually need that money. Most of the money my parents made was going to bills, rent and car payments. 

Anyway, i told my parents I got into a very good college out of state on a near full scholarship and that I’m planning to go. They asked how I can think it’s ok to just leave them to take care of Mary’s baby. I asked why I should stay in a shared bedroom with my sister and young niece for my college years? They said not everything is about what I want and sometimes people make sacrifices for family as they are doing. Mary jumped into the conversation by saying she wouldn’t go off to another state and leave me a single mother alone if the roles were reversed. I said she isn’t alone, our parents are here. She said it’s not the same because they’re always gone for work.

45,"Hello all. Hope all is well. Let's get down to it.

So my original AITA was about showing favoritism for my daughter and financially hurting my son. The comments went way far from that topic. It was interesting for me. For the people who sent me aggressive messages,  not cool.

Some questions to be addressed.

1. Why would I just not pay for everything?

I am trying to teach my kids about financial responsibility. Money has value, and nothing is given without work.(I bet if my son posted his view, you would call him entitled AH)

2. But they were so young when they started gambling with money in the stock market.

True. But they have grown up since then. Yes, they are still kids. But maturity does not just develop at 25 like some people on here think.

3. You gave them their college fund to waste.

No. College fund has always been secured and untouched unless I was putting money in it. They used allowance money.

3. Why are you not giving him a good start in life?

He has a better start than the majority of people.

So, I talked to my daughter. She said she would be upset if I just gave him the money. She worked hard and values her time and effort. I agreed that would be a bad idea. But we came up with 3 options (I added a 4th) to present him/my ex-wife. All of them had rules attached, and the same amount would be given to my daughter. Rules grades, housing rules, and behavior

1. He sells his car and some of his shoe collections to save money and put it towards the fund, and I will help him again to make passive income.

2. He picks a lower college that is more cost effective but still a good school. He gets a job, and I will match his pay.

3. I just give him the money. But as a loan. 0%interest, but he has to pay back in a timely manner. (Money, if paid back, will go back to him in the future. Down payment or wedding or something)

4. Ex and family put in the difference in the account.

I layed it all out for him. My ex and him did not like it. So I asked my ex why she is pushing this so much and why she has not put any money into the account since we originally opened it. There were excuses , and she finally said, ""I have to save money to my daughter(6 almost 7F). Unless you want to set up a fund for her as well."" (I am setting things up with MY youngest daughter (3f) the same way I did with my twins. I'm not doing it for her daughter)

Anyway, I have given him a few weeks to figure out what he wants. He acknowledged that I was right. He was unfair to his sister about the way he went about things and will do better in the future. He picked a modified version of option 2. He is still going to his #4 pick, is looking for a job, sold some shoes, and said he will be responsible for housing costs. He apologized to me and his sister. I hope he keeps working hard towards his goals.

TLDR; Gave my son options. He picked and negotiated it. He will go to a collage he wants to. Ex-wife is pissed at me.",1,,None,None,,,,
46,"Context: S and I were friends before I knew he worked where I got hired. He and I had been friends for 5 years. 


So, I year ago I got hired in as a manager at an auto parts store. I did not know my friend S worked there too because he was on vacation when I was hired. We have been friends for about 5 years and made jokes with each other all the time. I’m able to turn off “friend mode” when at work and that’s something S has always struggled with. 

Being the only female in the parts store had me it easy for customers to make judgements and lewd comments. I’m used to it. From customers. My coworkers know my boundaries and don’t make such comments. 

About 2 weeks ago, S and I were closing and I was working on a shelving fixture when he called for me to come up and put in my manager code. I don’t remember what for. I answered that I’d be right there with my pen in mouth because my hands were full.

When I came up he was laughing because I sounded funny when I answered him. I told him it was because my pen was in my mouth. He laughed and said “you like things in your mouth, don’t you?” IN FRONT OF A CUSTOMER!!!! 

Being that we’re friends, if he had said that same line outside of work, it probably wouldn’t have bothered me. But I’m his boss and he said in front of a customer. 

I notified my boss, who notified his boss, who notified HR. Now S is being transferred out of the store and is being put through the “respect in the workplace” course. Which goes on his record with the company and he’s being moved to a store with no female employees. 

S is obviously very mad about the transfer and blames me. He told me to never talk to him again and called me a petty bitch.

47,"I'm one of three kids. I have two younger brothers. I love my mom but she is ~~an~~ overbearing and likes to meddle. She doesn't do it to me because 1) I joined the armed forces almost right after I turned 18 (I'm 39 now) and haven't lived at home or near my hometown since then 2) I now live on the other side of the country 4000 kilometres away 3) I'm gay so there's no daughter-in-law for my mom to push around. I married my husband in 2006. Since we were both in the armed forces we had a military wedding, so there was nothing for my mom to take over when it came to the planning. My husband and I travel to visit my family only once a year and we always stay in a hotel instead of with my parents. I talk to both my parents on the phone often but I run interference between my mom and my husband so she can't bother him. It probably also helps that neither me or my husband have social media so she can't spy on us with it, and we don't want kids either.

It's a different story for my brothers. Neither of them have any boundaries with mom and they let her walk all over them and their wives/girlfriends. Mom has keys to their houses and she insists they live in the same neighbourhood as her and dad, as close to them as possible. My brothers have been married before. Both of them are divorced and one got remained. Mom took over the wedding planning. She meddles in everything including how they raise my nieces and nephews. My other brother was engaged to be married again but the relationship ended before the wedding. My mom's meddling and control definitely contributed to both of my brother's getting divorced and the end of my brother's engagement. She is involved in their daily lives and definitely butts heads with any women my brothers get involved with. 

My brother who is divorced and remarried complained about mom's interference to me the last three times we talked. Both of my brothers complain about that but it was almost the only thing he talked about. After the third time I told him he only has himself to blame and that led to a fight because he thinks I don't understand. He got our other brother involved and he agrees with him (my brother) and is against me.

My brothers are adults with their own money. They are not dependent on my parents for employment, or financially. There is nothing stopping them for telling mom to back off and drawing up some boundaries. I do think they only have themselves to blame even if they try to fight me on that. What I said definitely lead to a fight but I think I'm right and not TA here.",2,,4,2,,,,
48,"I’m (28f) my brother’s (16m) guardian due to shitty family circumstances. He has a part-time job at a restaurant. On weekdays, he works until 10pm. I pick him up from work on weekdays because I don’t want him taking the bus at that hour. We live in a big city and I worry about him being out at night by himself.

I went out of town for a few days for work. When I was gone, my boyfriend agreed to pick up my brother from work. He only had to pick him up once.

When I got back, I found out that he didn’t do it. He said that he forgot, despite me texting him twice that day to remind him. He went to hang out with his friends instead, so when my brother texted him to ask if was coming, he said that he couldn’t because he had been drinking. My brother took the bus instead.

I asked my boyfriend about it and he said it’s not his fault because he “just forgot”, and it doesn’t matter because nothing happened to my brother anyway. He’s said before that I’m overprotective of my brother. I disagree with that, but I digress. He didn’t apologize and instead said that I was being ridiculous. 

My brother would probably be okay if he took the bus every night. But I would rather drive him around than roll the dice on that. The area that we live in isn’t exactly safe. And regardless, that’s not the point.

I asked him to do one thing while I was gone, which he agreed to and then reassured me that he would do. I don’t really believe that he actually forgot because he doesn’t generally forget to do things when I ask him to, but I suppose I can’t be certain of that. 

We got into a fight about it. He said that I’m being irrational, but I don’t feel like I was wrong for being upset with him? But I want an outside perspective.",1,,1,2,,,,
49,"My SIL has a 5 year old son who comes over to play with my 3 year old daughter. Yesterday when he came to play he kept smacking my daughters bottom.

Later that evening when he had gone home I sent his mom my sil a message, very politely stating that I'm not being malicious or rude but please can you tell your son not to smack my daughters bottom. She replied saying she's spoken to him and it won't happen again. Fair enough. About 30 minutes later I got a message from my husband who is abroad, asking what happened between SIL and her son. Basically his brother (sils husband) told my husband that I could have told my nephew off and didn't have to escalate further by telling his parents. He stated that nephew will no longer be coming around and nor will he and his wife. I genuinely don't think I did anything wrong but I feel overwhelming guilt that I may have caused a little tension and separation which I did not think would be the case. So am I the AH for bringing it up and telling sil. I should also state that had I told him off they would have been very offended but I told them instead and they're still offended, they don't take well to anyone telling their son off hence why I only did it once.",1,,1,1,,,,
50," I live in a small town with a lot of gossip. Rumors spread like wildfire in our town. At every get-together, you are sure to hear many stories that start with ""So and so told me that..."", which I honestly hate.

As most people already know, rumors always get worse over time. Stories never stay the same.

I usually ignore rumors as much as possible, mostly because I couldn't care less who cheated or who lied. I try to stay away from the drama and I don't engage when people try to tell me about all of the crappy stuff some random person did

That being said, in the past few years, I started noticing that stuff I told my parents in private started circulating as well. There have been multiple instances where someone I didn't know would stop me in the street to hear about a situation that was going on in my family at the time. They'd tell me that someone told them about it, but I would never get a clear answer as to who told them, probably because the origins of a rumor are always hard to trace. I suspected that my elderly neighbors had been eavesdropping and sharing the information with others because they will always have a reason to be outside whenever one of us is outside. They will randomly insert themselves into the conversation we are having and ask us personal questions or they will ask for details on the situation even if they have nothing to do with it.

Upon talking to the other neighbors we discovered that other people had the same issue.

We have confronted our neighbors in private before, telling them to keep their noses out of our business. If we want outsiders to know what’s going on in our private lives, we’ll tell them ourselves. We don’t need or want them doing that for us.

A week ago my dog passed away. My neighbors came over that afternoon to demand details. We refused to share details and they backed off.

Yesterday, a random person I didn’t know asked about my dog. When I asked them how they knew about it, they told me that - according to our neighbor - I had been almost desperate to share this information with her. I was told that “I needed someone to talk to, so my neighbor allowed me to vent”. I got really mad and told this woman that my neighbor had been eavesdropping.

This afternoon our neighbors came walking in, accusing me of “trying to make them look bad” to their friend. They said I should have told them that I didn’t remember talking about it. Saying that they eavesdropped made them look like bad people. I told them that I was not going to lie and that they did, in fact, eavesdrop.

My parents backed me up, saying that I did the right thing.

The neighbors have to pass through our backyard to get to their back door, and when my dad checked the garden, he saw that our dog’s grave had been destroyed. This caused a fight ending with my neighbors saying that we would be excluded from neighborhood parties going forward. We said that we were fine with that.",1,,1,1,,,,
51,"I'm a 17 year old guy with two dads I call them Cole and James for the post. 9ish years into my parents relationship Cole was in a bad accident, broke multiple bones and suffered a TBI (traumatic brain injury). He almost died. Nobody really knows how he survived. He and James had lived together for years and considered themselves married but could not legally marry in the state at the time. Even though Cole had James down as his emergency contact and the person to make decisions for him, Cole's parents heard about it, took James to court and won the right as his family to make those decisions. They kicked James out of the hospital, called the police on him for harassment because he left the room but went to the waiting area. They said since Cole would likely have lost most of his memories they could get him straightened out. Cole's siblings, all older than him, were on board and also made it clear to James that he was never going to see Cole again.

Cole woke up with 10 missing years of memory. His parents wanted to keep it that way. Which meant he made no progress for months. Doctors were concerned because they believed he could but he just didn't try. Cole's family didn't care. They were adamant Cole was better never improving and staying as he was then trying to see if James could help. Until one of Cole's cousins decided it was cruel and something should be done. It was when James came to see Cole that he started to find a will to do something. Cole always told me that his heart knew James where his brain didn't and he gave him the will to want to improve and his family did not. Cole had to insist his family be removed and James take over.

Eventually Cole improved enough to go home and then when he improved enough to get some independence back, they moved out to a state where they could legally marry. I came along a few years later. My parents were very honest with me about their past, about Cole's disabilities, about his family. I always knew they were not safe people. Cole's family wanted to know me because they believed I was biologically Cole's.

Cole's parents died within a day of each other a few weeks ago. His siblings reached out to tell Cole. He wanted nothing to do with any of it. Then they got in touch via social media and tried calling me via Messenger. I ignored it. They sent me a message saying my grandparents would have wanted me there and how I shouldn't ignore my loss. This is when I called the account messaging me and when one of them answered I said I lost no grandparents and as far as I was concerned it was good that the world had lost two more homophobes. Then I ended the call. I blocked them but another account was made and they accused me of being evil and said James had raised me to be evil and sick just like him. They also harassed Cole off social media and into taking out our landline (which we had because it is easiest sometimes for Cole to use still).

52,"I (24F) take care of a majority of the housework. I work from home usually about 4-6 hours a day. My husband (23M) does some things around the house, mostly when I ask. He is gone at work M-F from 7:30-5:30. So it makes more sense that I take on a majority of the house work. I make him breakfast and lunch and cook dinner every single day and He usually thanks me for these things, but I see that as things I don’t actually have to do. I do the  because I want to do it for him, and he is good about thanking me for it. Which is great. There are times that he will do house chores like dishes, vacuuming, etc. but is very sporadic. But I don’t ever thank him for it, it’s just stuff that has to get done around the house. I rarely get thanked for doing things around the house, but I don’t need that because it’s stuff that just has to be done. He’s recently complaining that the reason he doesn’t do things is because I don’t thank him for doing the house chores. I honestly don’t want to thank him because we are supposed to be a team in taking care of the house. 

Last night He ended up doing a lot of stuff like the dishes, vacuuming, resetting the kitchen, brushing the dog, etc. and he made a comment after dinner today about and I jokingly said “thank you” and laughed a bit, not rudely. Then he said that it makes him want to do chores when I thank him, but when I don’t he doesn’t want to do them. And then a heated discussion ensued. I ended up telling him “I’m not going to do anything around the house now unless I hear a thank you and that means I’m not doing [insert super long list of stuff I do]” and he said “fine” but he seriously wants me to thank him after every single chore he does. And I just won’t do it. He’s not “helping” around the house. He owns this house too and it’s also his responsibility to know of the stuff that needs to get done around here. It overwhelms me sometimes that everything is on my plate, and when I have to think about what stuff he can do and then teach him how to do the thing - it’s even more overwhelming. So, AITA for not wanting to thank him for doings his share of work around the house? (Even though it’s only a few tasks that he sometimes does) PSA I love my husband so much, this is just something that is irritating, and I would love to know if I’m in the wrong so that I can make changes within myself.


**Update** thank you all for taking the time to express your opinions/give advice, and especially thank you to those that gave very helpful insight! 

My husband and I talked through this right after I posted this. We both admitted to areas where we can improve regarding this. And YES I will be thanking him more! No it’s not hard to say thank you, but it wasn’t about that, there was more to it! Regardless, I was in the wrong there, I’ll admit that! 

Also, there’s so much context and backstory missing, so please just remember that you never have the full story - but you literally can’t put everything here because it would take years to write and no one’s got the time to do that or read that. 

I have an AMAZING loving husband who is far more mature than me, we are growing together and giving each other grace upon grace. So, Please don’t attack his character. I could bet that he would be the nicest man you’d ever meet in your life! And he would do anything for anybody. 

Also, I wanted to reiterate that we agreed that I would take on a majority of the household duties because I work at home and it make more sense. This was something that I proposed! (Btw he only works 8 hours, but he is gone from 7:30-5:30, I average 4-6ish hours but that means that many days I work 8+clocked hours. But not always!)

53,"My (54M) mother (77F) lives in a dementia care facility. She has been living there for a little over two years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about 4 years ago. My brother Todd (51M) has always been mom’s favorite. He didn’t move out of her house until his early 30s because of his “mental health issues”. He was always a bit of party-goer and spent his early 20s getting high and relying on our parents to take care of him. Because of this, our mom has always been over-protective of him and has always catered to his every need. When our father passed away in 2014, our mom signed paperwork to make me her Power-of-Attorney when she were to need it because I have always been more responsible and mature than Todd and he could not be trusted with that responsibility. 

A little over a week ago, Todd visited our mom and a few days later I visited her. When I was at the facility, a nurse told me that my mom did not recognize Todd and was upset someone she did not know was in her room. I then told the facility’s administrator that she is to not have any visitors other than me. As her POA, I feel it is my responsibility to make sure she feels safe and happy where she lives. Since she does not recognize family a lot of the time and could get upset when someone she doesn’t recognize is in her room, I told the facility staff to not allow any visitors except for me and my wife. We are the ones who see her the most and are the ones that are most involved with her care. 

This is not something I wanted to do, but it’s what I felt I had to do to preserve my mom’s happiness as much as possible. Now my brother and his daughters (my nieces) have been calling and texting me constantly for the past week calling me an asshole for not allowing them to see their mom/grandma. I explained to them that this isn’t about them, it’s about my mom and what is best for her. But they are not understanding that and insist they should be able to visit her even if they do not recognize her. I offered to have them video call her (the facility has tablets they let residents use to video call family) but they said that’s not the same and are still calling me an asshole for not allowing them to visit. 

I think it is my job to do what’s best for my mom, and having visitors in her room that she does not recognize is clearly upsetting to her, but all of the backlash from my family has made me second guess. AITA?

Edit: since this has come up a lot, my brother and his family are welcome to visit my mom with me there. They do not like this solution because my brother works nights and it is hard for us to find times when we are all available. I offered to have set times a couple days a month that we all go visit together but they are against that and insist on being able to visit whenever.",2,,1,4,,,,
54,"First of all, I have two moms, and I'll refer to them as mom (41F) and mama (43F).

In my country, we have these public schools that are kind of like a combination of regular high schools and community colleges. They offer a program that takes an extra year but grants you an equivalent of an associate degree. The catch is, you have to pass an entrance exam and score higher than other students.

My uncle (thirty-something years old, male) attended this school when he was my age, and he convinced me to attend it too. I (14F) studied during one year before the exam. During this time, my uncle checked on my studies at least every other weekend. His help made a big difference for me and I'm very grateful. But he wasn't going completely out of his way to help me. My uncle always visited our home because he's very close to my mom (his sister).

My brother (14M) is dyslexic. He was trying to get into the same school, but he couldn't pass the exam. Our moms even hired a private teacher to help him for two hours every Saturday. I'm not blaming my brother at all, he always struggled in school. He improved his knowledge so much during the last year, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough. I'm very happy at my new school, but my brother is miserable about his failure and his grades dropped significantly.

My uncle worked as a private tutor as a side job when he was young, but he didn't want to help my brother because he doesn't have any experience with kids who are neurodivergent.

Besides, my uncle bought a video game for my brother's birthday. It would be considered an expensive gift in my country, except my uncle bought a 10 times more expensive smartphone for my birthday. This made my brother resent me even more, and now he calls me ""golden niece"" whenever he's mad at me.

Now, my first semester at the new school is about to end, and my moms are really pressuring me to go back to my old school. Their argument is that I won't even use the degree I'll get from this program because I plan on going to college after high school. They say I'm just wasting a year of my life. Also, I’m making mom drive me half an hour every day to take me to school.

I complained about them to my uncle and they had a massive fight. My uncle said he would take the matter into his own hands if they forced me to drop out (I don’t know what he meant by that since he can’t really stop them).

Am I a selfish asshole for favoring a good school over my family?",1,,1,2,,,,
55,"So I really don't think I'm TA here.

My (29F) sister (28F) lately has been taking it upon herself to organize family dinners for ""quality time"". She's newly married, so I don't know if it's a nesting thing or what.

Saturday is my daughter's birthday, and I organized a party for her. She's turning four, and I invited everyone.

My sister decided to organize a dinner right after the party for ""mother's day"" so she doesn't have to, in her own words, ""drive all that way twice"". She lives 30 mins away..

Anyway, she made the reservation. She told us. I said uh sorry no, that's my daughter's birthday, and even if her party is over at that time, we are going home and my daughter is going to enjoy her ENTIRE birthday. (She's four, so I'm sure she will want to go home and open all her new toys), and they don't need me there if they want to do their mother's day time with our mom the same day. 

I can see our mom on actual mother's day.

For some background they do this a lot. My sister's son (8M) gets the WHOLE family at his soccer games, but no one comes to my daughter's gymnastics. I made big plans for Easter, which included inviting them to an Easter Fair specific to kids with sensory issues. (My daughter is autistic). They showed up late, missed the entire hunt, and left after only a few minutes because everyone made plans for the zoo last minute, and then guilted ME for not wanting to go. They treat my daughter like being little and autistic means she's incapable of getting her feelings hurt or that shes not able to see when they're doing this.

She has babysat for me literally barely a handful of times. When her son was little I watched him CONSTANTLY while she went out. My in laws family knew him better than her in laws, because I was always forced to either bring him with me or cancel plans. She left me with him, after I said no, at my own bridal shower because she had a date (with her now husband).

Anyway, it turned into a HUGE argument with my family, my sister left the family group chat. I got called selfish by literally everyone. 

Apparently my sister was making some kind of announcement at this dinner, and her husband was busy on actual mother's day. 

I said, ""I don't care, pick a day that's not my kids birthday. I'm busy the WHOLE day, not just the length of the party.""

Noone is speaking to me now. And likely no one is coming to my daughter's birthday at all.

UPDATE:

Thank you everyone for all the support. It makes me feel a lot better, especially since the smear campaign is still ongoing.

I blocked the number of the main FM (my older brother, 40), cancelled the arcade reservation, and decided to take the few people who were coming to Knott's Berry Farm! The price shakes out to about the same, and I can contact their accessibility department for resources and guides for the special needs kids. I think this is going to go way better. My mom is ditching the mothers day dinner ""for her"" and coming with us because she said my daughter's birthday is more important than another mother's day, so I'm feeling really good about that.

56,"My husband and I have both sets of our parents living in the same city as us. We decided to have a weekly dinner with each set of parents so that we could see them regularly.

My parents get Saturday night. My sister, her husband and daughter also live in the same city and come to my parents house on Saturday as well so that we can all hang out

My MIL and FIL get Friday night. We spend our Friday evenings with them either at their house or ours

For a while now my MIL has been complaining about us giving my parents Saturday evenings. She thinks we’re favoring my parents by giving them Saturdays. Her reasoning for wanting Saturdays is that it is one of her days off and in turn she would have more time to prepare a meal for us. She wants to relax all day and then have us come over 

Currently my parents live 35 mins away from us on a good traffic day. If we were to go on any weekday evening it would take us upwards of 50 mins to an hour to get there. My In Laws live 10 mins away from us, it’s much easier to go over on a weekday. 

My mom does a fast for religious reasons every Friday and has for as long as I can remember. She only eats specific foods and has her meal about mid day therefore if we were to go over to my parents’ house on Friday she would have to just watch us eat

Also we can’t give my parents Sunday because we go to temple in the evenings.

We spend the same amount of time at each parent’s house. We don’t go to my parents house on Saturday and spend the whole day with them. We go there for dinner (about 2 hours) and do the exact same thing with my In Laws but on Friday and for the same amount of time

I gave it a try though, recently we have given my In Laws Saturday nights every few weeks. Never has dinner been made nor any sort of special meal my MIL claimed she needed the time for. I'm in the kitchen still helping her cook every meal once we get there. We spend the exact same amount of time there as we would if it were a Friday night. Everything is absolutely the same. 

This past week she complained again and I refused to give her Saturday. My husband agrees with my reasonings but he feels bad for her and thinks we should just do it for her. He thinks that I shouldn’t be holding onto this too much and I should just deal with the driving and my mom not eating and go to my parents on Friday even though Saturdays also work for my sister and I get to see my whole family at once. 

He thinks I’m being an asshole for not considering her feelings and not going to their house this past Saturday. I think the way things are (Fridays for my In Laws and Saturdays for my parents) makes it possible for us to have dinner and spend time with everyone, which was the point of all this in the first place 

AITA for not giving my MIL Saturday dinners?",1,,1,1,,,,
57,"Me(44F) and my ex-husband(48M) have three kids(16M,14M,11M). 6 years ago, my ex-husband had a psychotic episode in the car that almost ended in a fatal accident for all of us and since that, he is in a mental hospital. Before that, we were having a hard time with his mental health issues because he basically lost his sanity after his older brother(46M at that time) passed away suddenly due to a stroke when our youngest was 7 months old but this was a whole new level. 

He couldn't control his emotive responses since then and we never left him alone by himself or with the kids but the societal guilt of being a divorcée always had a big toll on me and I didn't want to lose my ILs so I stayed in the marriage. After this accident happened, my ex-husband was held on a psychiatric hold for the 4th time in the 5 years and the doctors in the hospital said it would be better if he is transferred to a permanent unit. We accepted, our marriage got annulled, I had the sole custody of the kids and all of his assets have been passed on to me as a child support. His family also wanted this.

I still have a good relationship with my exIL's but we have moved to a different city so we don't see them as much as we used to(twice or thrice a year). When we go to their house, I sometimes go see my ex husband but he is not himself most of the time. He is diagnosed with DID and he has more than 12 different personalities. My oldest knows his dads condition and he visited his dad once but the other two doesn't remember that much. 

We were with at exIL's place last month and at the 2nd day, my MIL tried to take them out. It wasn't surprising for me to see them going somewhere with their grandma but I still asked where they were going. I was waiting for ""To the mall"" or ""To a movie"" etc. but she said ""Oh, we are going to ""Hospital's Name."" to visit ""exHusband""."" I turned white really fast and FIL had to hold me. He looked at my MIL and asked kids to get inside. We had a big fight and after that we turned back to our house with FIL beside us. Now, everyone is blaming me for holding back the truth and MIL has contested divorce with FIL and all of their family is supporting her(even FILs sisters and brothers). AITA?",1,,1,3,,,,
58,"Background:

We lived in SC for 3 years. Things were awesome. We made many friends and it felt like home.

Then, my husband wanted to move back to Montana. His mom said we can stay at her place to save to buy a house there. I did not want this, but my husband said he wanted to move back, and we could always visit SC.  I saw that he missed home and probably didn’t love SC as much as I did, so I compromised.

The issue:

We have been back in Montana at his parent's house for the past 9 months. When everyone is off work, I feel pressured to be “present” at dinner time. I don’t mind this occasionally – but every day is taking a toll on my mental.

Sometimes I just want to relax on my own/with him. However, his parents are automatically included in many plans. For instance: When I went on a trip to Denver, my husband texted me “I want to take you out for sushi, let’s do that when you get back :).” I got excited because I thought that meant a date night. But when I got back, it was all of us going out for sushi.

Yesterday:

He said, “Let’s go to church and then the movies afterward with my parents.” I said, “Can just the two of us have lunch?” and then he said, “Let’s go pick up Chipotle and take it home and then go to the movies \[with his parents\].” And then I said, “No I mean have a nice lunch, the weather is so nice! Let’s grab lunch outdoors – just us.” And then he said, “I’m not in an outdoors mood, I'm in a movies mood.”

Then I told him I feel like we do everything with his parents. I didn’t want it to come out the wrong way and he cut me off and said, “Too late.”  And I said, “This is nothing against them – I want us to do our own thing.” He said, “You’re not about to cut out my quality time with my family.”

I grew angry because we LIVE with them, have dinner with them almost every day, and go on dates with them.

After we grabbed Chipotle to-go, I started bawling. I told him I can’t enter the house looking like this, I need to take a breather. But he pulled up in his parent’s driveway. As he was getting out of the car, I told him “Please don’t tell them - I don’t want them to take this the wrong way.” He asked, “You’re not coming inside?” and I'm like “Are you serious!? You really want me to come in looking like this!?” So, I left for my parent’s house to get some space. It’s been two days and he has not checked in. I feel like I offended him, but I don’t know how else I could’ve voiced my concern.

AITA for telling him we spend too much time with his parents?

TLDR: My husband and I moved to his parent’s home in Montana. After going on many double dates with his parents and having dinner after work with them almost every weeknight, I told him I feel like we do everything with his parents. He got mad and said that I'm trying to cut down his quality family time. AITA for saying we spend too much time with them?",1,,1,2,,,,
59,"This is regarding my sister (age 25) and her husband (age 26). Neither of them have jobs. They try to be Youtube stars or content creators or whatever but they earn almost nothing from Youtube, instagram or pateron. They relied on my parents and his parents (mostly) to support them, or social assistance. His parents have more money than my parents. From what I understand his parents said enough and cut my sister and her husband off when they retired and downsized. My parents are still helping them out and I think maybe others from my family or his (like grandparents or my uncle) but I don't know for sure. I was never bothered about giving them money because I was a student and didn't have any extra money.

The game has changed because my sister is pregnant. My sister and her husband as well as my parents, asked me (age 29) for money because of the baby. Since last year I'm not a student anymore. I'm working and I don't have debt. I'm being asked since his parents cut them off. They know about the baby but are holding firm. There's nothing wrong with my sister and her husband that they can't work so normally I'd tell them to shove off but I'm being pressured to be a helpful sister because of the baby. I could afford to help a little and I'm not sure if I'd be the asshole if I didn't because now there is a baby. I'm honestly not sure if I'd be the asshole here.",1,,3,1,,,,
60,"My sister has two kids. An 11 year old girl and a 10 year old boy. Their father and my sister were married, unhappily, before he died. Both were amazing parents who loved their kids. They did not work as a couple. Both were so young when they started dating and then she got pregnant and they fought to try and make a family work for the kids but it only made them hate each other over time. Then he died and my niblings were heartbroken. At 5 and 6 they were young but he was one of their two favorite people.

My sister has remarried since, about a year ago and she recently learned she was pregnant. She had this big photo perfect announcement planned with her, her husband and the kids, to show their excitement for the new baby arriving and the growing of their blended family. Except my niblings are not excited and this was not a happy thing for them. They told my sister they didn't want to be part of her announcement and when she asked why, they said they kind of hate that she is pregnant with someone else's baby and they don't want to be a blended family. She was heartbroken. She questioned them on why and they said her husband is just her husband and not their dad and this baby ""isn't dad's"" and how they wouldn't have chosen for a baby to come along.

It's been weeks now and my sister is mourning the announcement she planned and I think she is holding onto some negative feelings toward the kids. I think she dropped the ball a lot on this because clearly she never asked her kids how they felt about her husband or about the changes that had come into their lives. She just assumed they were happy and now her bubble has burst.

The kids told me the other day she was different with them now and they wondered if they could live with me because they think their mom just wants her new family now and not them if they don't want the new family. This is when I knew I needed to speak to my sister. She told me how much of a shock it was for her kids to say they weren't excited and didn't want the family they have. She also told me how much it broke her heart that they didn't do the announcement for her and now she won't be able to show the baby this exciting, loving announcement they get older, won't be able to show how the whole family was excited for their arrival. I told her she needs to let go of the fact she won't get her announcement as she wanted it. That she has two kids who need her and she needs to help them through this because they think everyone would be better off if they lived with me and that is not good for them to feel that way. She told me I was being unfair to her and piling on about something she's upset about. I told her she always told me being mom came first, her kids needs came first and that meant sometimes adults had to deal with their own shit quickly. I told her that was what her kids needed right now.

She still told me I came down too hard but I think it sort of worked. She is still not happy with me though. So AITA?",1,,4,1,,,,
61,"I work at a sober living facility. There are about twelve people living there right now. The house charges rent to live there, but offers a sober environment for people recovering. I am not a therapist or social worker. I am there to supervise and drive people with DUIs to appointments. We have a company car.

I am told by my boss not to offer to buy people things. They have jobs. The house provides staples like shampoo and other items. I do not spend a dime of my pay on people living here.

My brother went to the same facility a few years back. He said it changed his life. So he has offered to provide wings and pizza for everyone once a month. He works at a pizza parlor so this is something he worked out with his boss, who was his sponsor in AA.  

We recently got a new client, Alberta (34F), who hates pizza. She got upset that I brought pizza + wings and nothing else. She asked if my brother would provide another type of food. She wants me to bring her something else on the night the pizza is there. I told her this was not happening. 

She approached me another time. She said she feels like I hate her because I won't change the meal provided during our movie night.  

Alberta: It is not fair to feed \[the clients\] and not me. 

Me: That is not happening. This is an offered treat. You work, you can order yourself something else.

Alberta: I feel left out. 

Me: The offer is free pizza. If you don't like pizza, then you don't like pizza. Don't ask me again to buy you food. 

Alberta: It makes me feel like no one wants me around.

Me: When you have a bad attitude, most people don't want you around.

62,"

I own a home with a shared side yard. I am assuming the property line is somewhere in the middle of this small shared area-my deed does not specify. There is no fence, we share a gate. 

The neighbors are a very nice older couple. The wife recently had a stroke. I felt awful, donated to their go fund me, gave them free wood, and generally offered support to both the wife and the husband. I want them to have a ramp and/or lift so she can get out of her house and go to her appointments. 

I came home one day, and there is a large ramp in the side yard. This was not discussed with me and last I knew it was going on the opposite side of their house or in the front. It is so close to my back stairs that I cannot access my backyard from that entryway. The only gate I have is the one we share. I can no longer move anything from my shed to the front yard. More concerning is that the ramp is potentially on my property, and is confirmed by the neighbors to be un-permitted. It comes from their second story and is very steep. To me it seems like a liability if she were to fall off or the ramp were to fail, as it is so close or potentially on my property. 

I would feel badly contacting the city, so I have refrained from doing so thus far. I should add that they have very little money. However-not discussing with me that one of my doors would be completely blocked seems entirely wrong. 

They offered to build me new stairs facing the other direction, but then I cannot access the front gate and still will not be able to move things in or out of my shed to the front. 

WIBTA for calling and reporting this structure to the city, considering their situation?",4,,2,2,,,,
63,"I (27f) found out I am pregnant via at home tests late on Thursday afternoon. I recently moved to the area my boyfriend grew up in. I do not have a doctor here yet. My boyfriend and his mom are away visiting family across the country. 

I am very close with his mom and have also gotten close with her best friend (F ~45) who is currently living temporarily with her locally and is an ER doctor here. 

On Thursday evening, after countless unanswered calls, I was debating going to the ER for testing / ultrasound (not ideal obviously but I needed to see a specialist asap). 

For quick context on why I had to react quickly, I had an ectopic pregnancy a few years ago that resulted in sudden internal bleeding and a near death emergency surgery. I am very high risk for another one.

So, after discussing with my boyfriend and taking his advice, I called the friend of his mom who was home and off-duty.

I explained my situation very directly and calmly and asked for her direction. 

She told me to not rush to an ER and gave a referral for the next day. I expressed how appreciative I was. She said call if anything came up that evening, and the conversation ended amicably. 

Fast forward 3 days. I receive a text at 12am from her. Here it is with some redactions for privacy:

“I feel that it is necessary that I make you aware of a few things. I feel that it was wholly inappropriate that you involve me in your personal drama.

X (boyfriend’s mom) is my best friend. I was placed in a no win situation by a person who clearly doesn’t understand boundaries. A person who relies on the fact that people are kind and accommodating even when their personal comfort is compromised. The sweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act is just that— an act. 

What I see is a subversive manipulative sociopathic person who had to go out of her way to ruin X’s vacation. And you used me to do it. Because you clearly have issues with boundaries I’m going to make this crystal clear. I am not interested in any further interaction with you. The Dr (her last name) free clinic is closed  You have crossed a line and I do not want to be saddled with your issues medical or otherwise. There is no need to respond to this text.”

While calling her was a difficult choice and my last resort, the more I’ve sat on the text message, the more I’ve started to think I am the asshole for not considering further the position I was putting her in. I can see how she felt I overstepped given her friendship with X. I spoke with X on my own on Friday, but that’s irrelevant here.

On the other hand, I can’t shake that - especially as a medical professional - she reduced my health concerns I shared with her over a risky pregnancy to drama in a 12am text. I know I was asking a huge favor, but i thought in the moment it was the best option in a tough situation where I was alone. 

AITA for involving someone - who I now very clearly know didn’t want to be involved - in my pregnancy situation?

64,"I just had a baby five months ago and am really overwhelmed with being a SAHM. My baby sleeps late (11pm) but keeps me up from 4am every one/two hours to breastfeed. My husband claims I “do nothing all day” because we get out of bed at 11am usually and I don’t start dinner/housework till about 3pm. But during this time I usually play with her, change her 50 times, cook breakfast and lunch for myself, breastfeed etc. I’m usually the one 90% of time to do her night routine and put her to sleep as well. He says cooking and cleaning is not his job. So it has been a lot for me. 

I’m currently under the weather and in the past five months when this has happened I usually have to still watch my baby during the day and watch the housework pile up until I feel better to do it. I asked my husband to let me go to my mothers house for two days so she can take care of me. 

He says I’m the AH because my mom doesn’t like him so he can’t see me while I’m there and I’m keeping the baby away from him and he planned to stay home from work to “take care of me” and that my mom should come here instead to take care of me",2,,3,2,,,,

This restaurant pools tips and tips out everyone including the dishwashers and cooks, which in the state the restaurant is in, isn't legal. To top it off the two managers were taking the majority of the tips and then tipping everyone out, servers and runners with a percentage to get them up to the state minimum wage and then $20-$50 for kitchen workers depending on their job. 

I left the job after Ron told me that the two managers take the majority of tips for themselves. After I left I called the DOL and reported them, because, of course I want my full wages that they took from me, and the DOL took up the case and have been carrying out investigations. 

Ron and I used to talk every day, and up until last week I hadn't heard from him much for a month. We talked for a little bit and then he told me about how the DOL was conducting interviews there all week and it ""seriously interrupted his life"" and I was an asshole for calling the DOL because he might have to payback all of the tips he's been accepting. He told me that I needed to apologize and i scoffed at that and he kept pushing it and I finally ""apologized"" with ""I'm sorry that you work for scumbags"" and followed up with ""I'm sorry that you might have to payback money you were happily accepting in an illegal scheme"" and hung up the phone.

66,"It is no secret my MIL and I do not have a great relationship. We are polar opposites and I like to think that is what drew my husband to me. I tend to get irritated by most things she does and I am not sure if I am TA and am over reacting or not. 

Back story-my MIL was single when we had our first child. Right before his first birthday is when we met her now husband.  While he is a kind person, he is also quirky. There have been some extremely awkward/slightly uncomfortable moments that make me have my guard up. He clearly cares for our kids, is generous with his money for their future (contributing to college funds), and my MIL has stated MANY times how he is so happy to be a grandparent because his own daughters will likely never have kids. Although my guard is up, I very much so recognize him as a grandparent to my children. He is more active in their life than my husband’s actual father. 

The first time we met this man (let’s call him Fred), my MIL half jokingly called him “Papa Fred”…my husband immediately shut it down. At my son’s first birthday party (a month after meeting Fred), she got mad at me for not posting the “grandparent picture” with Fred in it to our family-only picture app. My husband told her “he is your boyfriend. A grandparent role is earned, not forced.” I was so proud of him in that moment because he rarely stands up to her in this way. As their relationship continued, I noticed my FIL would say things or send texts to my husband like “I will always be your dad. Don’t forget about me” (he lives out of state). Clearly in his head about being replaced. 

Fast forward 3 years, Fred and my MIL got married about 6 months ago. She has increased the “Papa Fred” name dropping into conversations and is forcing it. Everyone kind of stops when she says it-very awkward-but then ignores it. My 4 year old asked me this week “why does grandma call him Papa Fred?”. Am I TA for wanting my husband to talk to his mom and get this to stop? In my opinion, calling him by the name my kids learned his as does not diminish him as a grandparent. His care, involvement, and day to day actions make him a grandparent…not changing (forcing) his name. It is confusing my kids. It is also really close to my FIL’s grandparent name and I feel it is disrespectful to him. My husband agrees with me it is uncomfortable but feels “we don’t have an argument” to tell her to stop. Am I being ridiculous? Do I need to just get over this? Or is this worth pushing back on?

UPDATE:
I completely hear y’all and realize it is not the name that I have the issue with. A good part of it is definitely the approach my MIL is doing it in for sure. To clarify, my guard is up regarding Fred’s inappropriate behaviors that my husband and I are monitoring as grooming behaviors towards my son. This is likely also clouding my feelings a little bit about the “grandparent name”. I do like the suggestions to sit with our kids and haven them decide what his name should be. This removes our adult feelings about it, respects the grandparent role he is serving, and allows the kids to dictate what his name will be (as they did with my MIL and FIL due to their speech challenges). Thank y’all for helping me differentiate these emotions. As a lot of family matters are, the water is muddy with emotions for various reasons.",2,,1,2,,,,
67,"My family will be moving in to our new home soon. I promised my (18f) sister(13f) that she can decorate and select the colour of our room as she wants. In my previous home we both kept our room as we liked but my parents let me paint it as I wanted. Obviously I painted with my sister's input but you could tell the room was exactly more of my style.

So my sister wanted the walls to be purple? I'm not sure but it was a shade of purple she wanted. But the day my dad asked for the final decision regarding the colour of room my sister was at school. I asked him to wait for her to come home but apparently it was urgent and he told me to either select or he will. I then selected a shade which was more like lavender but a bit more dark idk how to explain. My sister at that time assured me she liked it.

But today she decided to visit our home and saw the room and was really upset. The walls were not exactly the shade I selected. It was like a mix of lavender and pink according to her and it looked horrible. When she showed me I was shocked. It did look really weird. Both of us hate pink. She is blaming me now and says its my fault the room looks horrible and that I broke her trust when I promised she could do what she wanted.

My parents are like it's what you selected so don't come at us. I feel like I'm the asshole here because I won't be here in a few months but my sister will be for many more years. AITA?",1,,1,1,,,,
68,"I am a single mother of 3 children (18F, 15F and 11M). I don't have good financial conditions, my ex-husband pays a low pension (his salary is actually bad), we don't go hungry, but we don't have luxury. 

3 years ago, my father passed away and I received my share of the inheritance. One of my father's biggest wishes is for us to buy a house, pay off our debts and even help with the grandchildren's college. 

Tbh this money was totally used to pay off the house and pay my debts, what was left I made a big shopping (groceries( and paid the house bills, so I didn't reserve for my children. It was a difficult decision, but we went from being in debt to living paycheck to paycheck. Not ideal, but much better. 

Since they were young, I told my children that if they wanted to go to college, I couldn't help them if they decided to go to college outside the city and that they would have to work for it, but if they stayed in the city, they wouldn't need it so much because they would live at home . 

My oldest daughter got in  a great college and is looking for jobs in the city, as well as cheap housing and government subsidies for living expenses. She will start in August. 

An important context: My brother is doing well financially, we don't get along so well for random reasons, but our kids are friends. He has a son the same age as mine.

I think in one of her conversations about college with her cousin she found out that he had a college fund left with grandfather's inheritance.

 I never mentioned to my children that it was my father's desire to help his grandchildren, as it was up to us whether we did that or not. 

My daughter, when she found out, said that I could have saved money for the children and they wouldn't have difficulty in college, in addition to needing government help. Or having planned myself financially better. But that it was selfish to have ignored a grandfather's desire to pay for my things, unlike my brother who prioritized his son 

This hurt me a lot, as it was a necessary decision. But I told her that I did what was necessary to keep food on the table and she needs to get better at our situation instead of coming to complain to me about decisions that are solely mine and not hers about this money. 

We are not on good terms, she still thinks I made a selfish decision. 

AITA? 

TL;DR: I received an inheritance from my deceased father and one of his wishes was to help his grandchildren in college (optional) and I decided to use it to pay for the house and debts. My daughter found out about her grandfather's wish and now she's calling me selfish

Extra:
The debts are credit card expenses because I was unemployed at that time and I used up my cards for months to have food at home and pay the mortgage so we wouldn't be homeless. And the big groceries purchase was because we needed it after months of having the bare minimum at home. But 90% went to pay the house.

 These wishes of my father's were never written in will, only what the division would be. But he always told his children how he would like we spent (he was already in poor health)",2,,2,1,,,,
69,"My son has asthma and we are still learning his breathing triggers. But even without his asthma being a factor, I don't want animals at my house. We don't have pets outside of my son's 3 goldfish. I won't say I dislike animals, because I actually do like animals. But I hate shitty pet owners and can't tolerate being around them if I'm being honest. 

So my MIL has a MASSIVE 1 year old Mastiff/Rottie mix. Beautiful dog. She hasn't attempted to train him. I don't even like going to my MILs house because the second you walk on to the property this dog is jumping up on you and knocking you on your ass. His paws alone are damn near close to the size of my head. She has shown up here twice with her dog, without even telling us and I absolutely cannot deal with it. The dog never stops barking or playing and the chaos fucks with my head to a point of me being pissed and feeling trapped. 

Then there's my mom.. my mom is a farm girl. She has a whole slew of farm critters. Dogs, cats, goats, chickens, turkeys, cows, pigs and geese. Her business is basically breeding and growing meat goats. So, every year she has about 16+ baby goats that she has to bottle feed every 2-6 hours (depending on their size and age). Generally speaking, she ALWAYS has a goat with her. They are small and super cute but I don't want a flipping goat at my house when she comes to visit. She doesn't try to bring the goats inside or anything like that but she does let them roam around my yard and shit everywhere and chew on things and I'm so over it. 

So basically, when my son was diagnosed with asthma, I told both my MIL and my mom they couldn't bring the animals here anymore due to my kids asthma. I've told them they couldn't before the diagnosis but ultimately they didn't listen at all. But now that my son has this diagnosis, if they are to show up here with the animals they will be cut completely from our lives. My mother was fine with it but my MIL is pissed, saying her dog isn't the reason he has asthma and I'm just a dog hater and terrible person. AITA?",,1,3,3,,,,
70,"Forward: I'm pretty certain I'm the asshole, family agree I'm in the wrong, but one friend is saying I'm not. Also even if I'm not the asshole, my wife isn't either, she's an incredible mum, amazing wife, and the love of my life.

Me (33M) and my wife (30F) have a little baby (0.25F) who for the mostpart is a chill and happy little thing who makes our world shine. But as with any baby she cries and sometimes a lot.

I'm diagnosed autistic and as a result have some pretty severe sensory issues particularly around sound, and particularly when I'm tired. I have noise cancelling headphones which are a godsend so I started wearing them when I found her crying too overwhelming, particularly when I get up at night with her.

To clarify, I can still hear her crying and I don't put them on so I can ignore her crying. Quite the opposite, I wear them so I can hold her without feeling overwhelmed. Also it's just her being a baby, not a medical thing. Most of the time she's a joy, I love our 2am feeds when it feels like nobody else in the world is awake except us, enjoying the stillness and solitude. I love her so much.

My wife hates it and has asked me to stop. She said that being a parent involves having to cope with the bad stuff, it's what we signed up for and that it's important not to block out her crying so I can feel what our daughter is feeling. She also said that it probably scares our daughter to see her dad with stuff on his head when she's at her most distressed. What she said makes a lot of sense so I stopped wearing them and handled the resulting meltdowns afterwards. But when I was talking to a friend he said that's an unreasonable demand, I'm not a bad dad and my needs with my disability matter too.

TLDR; AITA for wearing noise cancelling headphones when my daughter is crying to manage sensory issues?",,1,1,1,,,,
71,"I (23f) still live with my parents and here lately they have really been in my business. Ever since me and my boyfriend got through our little break and have hung out more, my mom (51f) has been on me more about giving her my boyfriend and best friend’s cell phone numbers since I hang out with them frequently. Whenever I question her about it, she goes into this whole guilt trip about how there could be some emergency and she may not be able to reach me so she’d have to call whoever I’m with. Well, that went on and I caved and gave her my boyfriend’s number. She kept it in her notes app and said she’d only use it if she had to. 

Fast forward to three days ago, I’m at work. For clarification, I sometimes substitute at the daycare my mom works at, so we’re both there. She walks by and as I’m trying to wrangle the kids into a line, she comes up and says “you never gave me your friend’s phone number”. 

I’m already upset because of the kids, so I turn around and say “why do you need it so badly?” And she goes into the whole guilt trip thing I stated previously. That’s when I told her I have my phone on me all the time, she will be able to reach me when she needs me. I told her she’s treating me like a kid here recently and I’m almost 24, so she doesn’t need my friend’s or boyfriend’s phone numbers. Then she says I’m still her kid no matter how old I get. I said I get that, but she needs to back off and just let me live.

So I’m wondering if I’m the asshole in this situation, or are my actions justified?",,1,2,3,,,,

So, the other day, my (35m) twin nieces (Aria and Nina) had their twelfth birthday. For Aria, I got her an art bag (basically a small tote with hard backing and different sections and pockets) filled with art supplies. Colored pencils, watercolors, markers, sketchbooks, etc. Basically, a young artist’s cornucopia. For Nina, I bought some new softball supplies. New cleats, a batting helmet, twelve new softballs (she loses hers really easily), and a metal bat. 

When the girls were unwrapping their presents, they both loved them. My sister (the twins’ mom) shoots me a weird look, but I think nothing of it. Later, my sister gets me alone and confronts me about getting Aria “more things” than Nina. I respond that I tried to gear the gifts towards the girl’s individual interests. She said that that doesn’t matter, that Aria got more things (she did get more individual items) and that that wasn’t fair. 

I actually added up the total costs later because I was feeling unsure, and the two gifts were of similar cost (actually, Nina’s gift was $20 more expensive iirc). I did inform my sister of this. Still, she’s been cold to me since then, which is weird because we’re normally quite close. This is having me feeling even more unsure. 

AITA for my gifts to my nieces?",,1,2,1,,,,

I (25F) and fiancé (25M) are getting married in November and are keeping the wedding and wedding party small, we decided to just have a MOH and best man. My niece and nephew are the only family in the wedding, they are the ring bearer and flower girl. Recently my fiancé(25m) has been trying to add his sister (20f) into the wedding, he asked if I would switch and have her be my MOH instead of my best friend of 8 years, or up the wedding party size to two on each side. When I said no to both he suggested we make her the officiant, she will be 21 by the time we get married and I said no due to the fact that she’s so young, and I don’t think she could take it seriously enough. She’s never been a huge supporter of our relationship and definitely not the wedding. To add a little background when I first started dating my fiancé I was actually really close with his sister until she started to spread rumors about me to their family and our mutual friends, she went from being a close friend to someone I could hardly stand to be around. Part of the reason I don’t want her in the wedding is because she hurt me in the past and I can’t trust her to not ruin the wedding in some way if she’s in it. While it’s a small wedding we’re still spending a lot of money. So AITA for not wanting his sister in the wedding?",,2,1,3,,,,

75," 

I (17F) plan on moving out of my mom's (37F) house in late july, early august. I had originally planned on leaving after I graduate next January. My mom has heavily relied on me to watch my younger sisters (3F and 6F) throughout the day and when she goes to work at night. She is a bartender, so she doesn't get home until near 4 or 5 am. An important thing to know is that my older brothers (20M and 18M) both moved out before 18, as soon as they had the chance. My mom has a pattern of picking fights with one of the kids, typically the oldest in the house. So once the younger brother moved out, I was the target of these arguments. But, I was only 15 at that point, so I couldn't do anything. My mom doesn't like kids, including her own. She loves us, but she doesn't like any of us. Currently, she doesn't pick fights with me, and I believe the reason for that is because she needs me to take care of the girls. I try my best to deal with the girls, as I also don't like children, but they need me so I'm there. Many times, my mom will hide in her room and have me watch the girls as she's overwhelmed after they do one thing to piss her off. But whenever I endure hours of their behavior and try to ask for help, she says she's busy. When it comes to the dishes, we rotate turns. When it's my turn, she constantly nags at me to get them done. When it's her turn, she waits until we run out of clean dishes, and then still a few days, or really whenever she feels like it to clean. She complains to me about many things in a way of telling me to take care of them while she goes out with her friends and leaves me with the girls. Yesterday, I got to my breaking point when I had to clean up 3 very large messes made by the girls throughout the day while she sat in her room. I later brought up the idea of moving out before senior year, telling her it'll be easier on me and my friend I'm moving in with later on anyways. I am also taking my two small dogs, which are 11 and 8 currently. The one that's 11 is getting to be very snappy and short tempered. The girls often like to screw with her and the 8 year old until their breaking point. I am also taking one of the two kittens we have. My mom didn't say much and every time I've brought it up afterwards, she changes the conversation. She is clearly pissed at me. Something me and my grandma are concerned about is what will happen to the girls after I leave. My mom doesn't try to spend any time with them or work on their behavior in a beneficial way. My mom has also been mentally going off the tracks, slowly over the last couple of years. So really, I don't care what my mom thinks about moving out. I'm worried that I'm the AH for leaving my little sisters in that situation, which could become potentially dangerous. AITA?

76,"So I work at a big retail store overnight. I unload the trucks then stock the shelves. I’ve been there a few weeks and it’s been fine. Most of the people I work with are cool. They are the type to talk a lot of nonsense if you know what I mean. Talking about their girlfriends or wives etc. on this particular day one guy spoke about how he and his girlfriend are fighting and she’s not giving him sex. One other guy said that he should get used to taking care of himself. And that he does it everyday before coming to work. They then started asking a bunch of people and to my surprise most people were open and free about it. I wasn’t and just kept to myself. They made a joke about how I probably masturbate while I’m at work. 

In the end I tried to laugh it off but felt a bit uncomfortable. Later on I got reminded of it again and this time it really bothered me. I felt like it crossed a line and became harassment. So I went to my hr and told them everything. I said I didn’t feel comfortable working with those guys.

They gave me a few days off and I told my brother and his wife. My brother said that I overreacted and that’s how guys talk. His wife said that I had a right to not feel comfortable but that going to hr was extreme.

78," My (36f) and my husband (37m) live on a major thoroughfare in our neighborhood. Husband and I get by okay, but we are by no means well-off.

Today, about 3 pm, a family (dad, mom, three little kids) get a flat tire on our side of the street, a bit down from where our house actually is. They call the police, and the police help them push their car to a parking spot on the street in front of my neighbor's house. When they got the flat, I thought, ""Ah, that sucks, but it happens to the best of us, and hopefully they get help soon.""

Flash-forward to a few hours later. My neighbor has been entertaining/feeding the mom and kids since the flat happened. The dad has been dealing with the flat. Husband goes to take out recycling, and the dad asks him if he has an iPhone charger. Husband gives him the iPhone charger from his car, nbd, and asks for it back when the dad is done using it.

Six hours into the ordeal, the family is not any closer to getting home. The solution they've come up with is to ask Husband if they can have the donut from his car because they were driving on their donut, and it went totally flat. The full-sized tire they had that went flat last week is in their trunk. Husband says yes almost immediately (he hates saying no), then comes up to tell me what happened and that he doesn't really want to give them his spare tire because he doesn't think it'll fit, and that he's concerned about getting it back (he did get the dad's number). I tell him to tell the dad what he just told me, and he says that it feels unethical because he wouldn't want someone to do him like that if he was in the same situation. I ask what he would do if he was in the dad's situation, and he says that he'd call AAA. I tell him that I'll go deliver the news to the dad, and he says that he'll do it because otherwise it'll look like he sent his wife to do his dirty work.

Moments later, Husband is trying to get his spare onto the dad's wheel. It doesn't fit. Husband comes back up to the house, and we talk about it a bit. I tell him that I don't think he needed to offer his donut at all, and he says that he guesses we're just ""wired differently"" because he can’t say no to someone in that situation without a good reason. I tell him that ""I don't want to do this"" is a perfectly valid reason. I say there are other ways he can help besides giving them his spare tire, and he says, ""Like what? That wouldn't cost money?"" and, tbh, every aid I was going to offer (calling AAA, calling a Lyft for the family to get home, etc) would involve some amount of money, but not necessarily the same amount of money/hassle as a new spare tire would cost.

He's saying that I'm heartless for not offering everything I can to these strangers who happened to get a flat on our street. I say it's not our responsibility and that the fact that they're soliciting aid doesn't mean that we're compelled to give it in whatever form they ask. AITA?",,1,2,1,,,,
79,"I (22f) live with my best friend (21f). We have lived together for 3 years, and things have always been smooth. We have never had fought over anything serious, just the occasional spat over chores. Honestly, living with her has been great.

Last week, my roommate’s cousin (19f) came to stay at our place. We agreed to her staying 4 days. We are on day 6. The dynamic immediately changed when she arrived. Her cousin, who we will call Beth, is a self-proclaimed sex addict and alcoholic. She is incredibly rude. She refuses to pay for any food that she eats in our apartment because “it is rude to make your guests pay”. She leaves a mess everywhere she goes. She keeps shutting our AC off even though it’s humid and we live in Arkansas. Beth also has drunk all of the alcohol in our apartment without asking. 

All of those things I can take. Last night, however, was different. My roommate, Beth, myself, and our friends Mel and Zaya were hanging out. Zaya’s parents just split up and she was really upset about it. Beth took it upon herself to constantly remind Zaya that her parents are getting divorced to the point where Zaya was inconsolably crying. I told Beth to shut up, and she threw a drink in my face. Beth later told my roommate that she has been doing this on purpose to drive a wedge between all of us. She said it like it was a fun little game. 

My roommate and I got in our first real fight that night. My roommate has even been complaining about how awful it has been to have Beth here.

She complains about everything, from work to relationships to daily annoyances, and it's starting to take a toll on me.

Last week, we went out for drinks, and Sarah spent the entire time complaining about her job and how much she hates it. I tried to be supportive and offer solutions, but she just kept going on and on. Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore and told her that her constant negativity was draining and that I didn't want to be around it anymore.

Sarah got upset and accused me of not being a good friend. She said that I was being insensitive and that she needed someone to talk to. But at the same time, I feel like I'm not her therapist, and I can't constantly be her sounding board for her problems.

Now, I'm starting to second-guess myself. Was I too harsh in confronting her about her negativity? Should I have just let it go and continued to be a supportive friend, even if it's draining for me?

82,"I'm 17, turning 18 in less than a month. I am anxious and confused about the situation going on in my family and I'll try to explain it as well as I can.

When I was 12, my brother was born. During this period I pretty much started babysitting him, coming home from school at around 2PM and staying with him so that my mom could do whatever work she had to do/go shopping for groceries. Not only that, but I also babysat him whenever I was on holiday break, including all summer vacations. I ended up staying with him for well over 8 hours daily sometimes, more than my parents.

Now, my brother is turning 6 and doesn't speak properly. He's doing speech therapy and has been getting better. He acted up once at kindergarten which made my mom blame my dad and he got angry, not coming home that day and my mom let my brother cry about it and told him it's his fault as to why he's not home. My mom doesn't do much around the house as she sleeps most afternoons, but she said I also make messes so my dad told me to clean up after myself, so I did.

I came from school once and ate, washing my dishes after out of habit. She then came into my room, asking me if my dad taught me to only wash my own things and started crying. She went on the phone with her friend and after calming down came into my room again to tell me that I'm disrespectful towards her and just like my father. I told her that the whole situation is making me tense and she was condescending about it. I didn't mean to exclude her dishes or anything, but she also said she deliberately left them there to see what I'd do.

Today (and why I decided to make this post) they fought again, and my mom brought me into it. I have vocational work at school and need to pass it, and decided to go to my dad's workplace instead since the teacher agreed and I'd actually do something. My mom found out today and freaked out, telling me I should let her know when I make decisions like these (even though I'm nearly 18) and said that she raised a snake.

I know I could have raised my brother better even if it wasn't my obligation, but I spent my entire adolescence with him and I wasn't patient enough. My mom said she wants a divorce and 5000 euros, and told my dad to sell the house if he doesn't have the money (I don't know where I would live, not that he's gonna sell it.)

My dad has also talked about her when it's only me home, but not to this extent and mostly saying that he doesn't know what to do next. He did say the reason my brother's not talking properly is because she never spends time with him and never plays with him which I have thought about as well before. He tries to spend time with him but is busy.

I honestly don't know what to make of all this anymore, is there a side to my mother's arguments that I'm not seeing? Does she just come tired from work and I should have helped her more, or is my dad also in the wrong here? AITA?",,2,1,1,,,,

So basically I have curly hair

And no it’s not wavy that looks like it curls,it’s noticeable that my hair is curly

My friend however (Lola) has straight hair

Her hair is a lot thinner than mine, not thin to the point she’s balding because we’re both not even near the age for that to happen but her hair outlines her head shape while mine only outlines the top and my head shape becomes less noticeable 

Lola has always been one of those people who will criticize you and say “I’m just being honest” even tho when someone treats them the same they get upset

She’s that kind of person

So a few days ago I we saw eachother in our 3rd period but I was talking to my friend who was behind me

Me and Lola used to be a lot closer but one thing led to another and now we’re starting to drift apart

Anyways I had washed my hair that morning so the curls were nice and defined

She had said she liked them and as I was about to say thank you she said “I love your curls but they’re like really flat.. just saying”

Honestly this isn’t the first time she’s commented something like this, I was obviously sick of her and her commentary that no one asked for

So I’m return I said “I don’t care bro and plus look at your hair it’s way flatter than mine-?”

She responded with something like “i was just being honest u don’t have to act like that”

I can’t really remember what I said back to her but I do remember she turned around to her boyfriend and he called me an “angry bitch”

A week ago, my wife told me that SIL and her husband need to have their whole house fumigated and need to be out of the house for 48 hours.  She said SIL asked if they could come stay with us during that time since they only live 30 minutes away.  My initial reaction was ""no.""  My wife had already told me about the hell that SIL and her family was going through to get rid of the bed bugs, I don't want to risk a single chance that they could bring them into our home.  

My wife said that they had to buy all new clothes and wouldn't bring anything to our house that had any contact with the bed bugs.  She said that the bugs don't live on actual people and since SIL and her family wouldn't be bringing over any clothing or bedding that had bed bugs, we don't have anything to worry about.  She also said that since they picked them up at a hotel, they are obviously wary about spending nights in a hotel during the fumigation.  

I told her that I feel bad for them, but I don't want to take any risk of us ending up in a similar situation.  I don't care if it's even a 1% chance that we get bed bugs too, the things that SIL and her family have had to do to get rid of them sound terrible and to me it's not worth even the slightest risk.  To me, the only way we can be 100% sure we don't get bed bugs is to not have SIL and her family stay with us.

Of course, my wife is not happy about this and thinks I am being unreasonable and that this is the type of thing that family does for each other when they are in need.  I don't have anything against SIL or her family, but to me it's a simple fact of being absolutely sure we aren't exposing our house and family to the same situation that SIL finds her family in.  

My wife ended up telling her SIL that they couldn't stay with us, but now my wife is very upset with me.  She feels like the risk was low enough and that SIL and her family would be careful enough not to bring anything to our house that could bring the bed bugs with them.  But the whole situation that SIL's family is in sounds like something that I would never wish on my worst enemy and the only way we can be completely sure is to keep it far away from us.

I do feel bad for SIL and her family, I'm not heartless.  But my wife feels I should have trusted her and her sister to make sure that nothing would come into our house that would put us at risk.  SIL and her family ended up driving 4 hours to stay with some of her husband's family in a townhome that did not have nearly enough room for them.  

Now my wife feels like if we ever need help with anything, there's no way we can ask SIL because we didn't help them with this.",,2,3,3,,,,
85,"This is stupid but the daughter in question told me to post here to prove her right. So I guess we'll see who's side internet strangers are on. I'll keep this short. 

My family had steak tonight for dinner. There was a large piece of pure fat on one of the steaks which I cut off to throw away. My daughter (16) told me not to throw it out and that she wanted to eat it.

I cut her off a small slice from the fat and gave it to her, but she insisted I give her the whole thing. It was a huge piece of fat, which would be super unhealthy to eat. I told her no, she didn't need a slice of fat half the size of her entire steak, and said that would be ridiculous. She got upset that I ""forced her to waste food she wanted."" 

I see part of my responsibility as a parent to keep my children at least relatively healthy and not feed them pure beef fat just cause they want it. 

AITA for throwing it away?

Edit to clarify: it was on my plate I didn't take it from hers.",,1,2,1,,,,
86,"I (F36) have MS and one of the things that happens to me is my leg will twitch and it usually happens when I’m seated. Its often sore and It’s uncontrollable. Because if this, I’m afraid of driving. Surely rightfully so? 
Well, my husband (38) is getting sick of me not driving and being too scared to. I get it. Driving someone around would be a pain in the leg (huehue) but if I drive and my leg starts twitching, that’s it. I won’t be able to stop and I could cause an accident. He says i’m using weaponized incompetence to get people to drive me around. Sometimes I will spend so much money on an uber just to avoid hearing him putting me down. I feel like it’s getting to a point where I never want to leave the house and just ask for all my appointments to be via zoom. 
Is what I’m doing wrong? AITA?

Edit: Thank you all so much. It has been eating at me me all day long and honestly, has had me in tears. This is the one thing I really need assistance with. Everything I’m fine to do it on my own. I am thankful for the responses. I think I just wanted to really make sure I wasn’t using my condition to not drive. I am medically exempt and am not allowed to even have a license but lm still told to drive since it’s “just a few blocks away”. I’m definitely feeling a lot better",,2,1,1,,,,
87,"I love my girlfriend, we got engaged in February and we are going to get married this November. She's told her relatives but she wouldnt reveal our relationship to all her set of friends. Close ones know but not all. The other friends keep trying to pair her up and just yesterday she attended a wedding of a friend (who didn't know) and ended up also inviting her ex. I wasn't at the wedding but I did pick her up later and we had a great time. But the ex obviously saw her there, messaged a few of her friends and these friends were trying to convince her to give it a shot with the ex again. Now, they think she's single so not their fault honestly. We had a huge fight about this today and I got mad saying that I want everyone you know to know about us. But she likes keeping things secretive and wants to reveal it to people in her own way when shes ready. Am I the asshole here? Anyone with similar experiences?

EDIT: maybe I didn’t specify this, her mom knows, her family knows and a couple of her very close friends know too. It’s just like the general public which don’t know (old friends, office colleagues) which honestly shouldn’t be a a big deal but for some reason it doesn’t seem right to me",,1,1,1,,,,
88,"I (26M) am graduating from Law School next week. It’s a pretty big deal for me, as it’s something I’ve been working towards for several years now. My school is considered one of the top law schools in the country, and as far as accomplishments in life go, this is definitely my biggest one. 

I have asked my family to come watch my graduation. They are all flying into town for the event, and I have planned a nice dinner for all of us to celebrate after the graduation ceremony. The guest list includes myself, my parents, my dads second wife, as well as my older brother and his wife. 

To put it lightly, my family does not get along. My parents had a messy divorce a few years ago and things have not improved since then. The worst tension is between my brother and my dad. They barely speak to each other and are always at odds. Their respective spouses have also gotten involved in their feud, making matters much worse. 

My brother called me and told me that I am being selfish for expecting everyone to come together for this event. He says I that I’m being narcissistic and just want people to praise me. He called me a “chaos agent” who is forcing everyone to interact so that I can watch them argue. 

I don’t think that I’ve done anything wrong. I have a good relationship with all of them, and don’t think it’s too much to ask for everyone to get along for one weekend to celebrate my graduation. It really does mean a lot to me—I don’t have a partner or many friends to celebrate with. 

I feel like they’re the ones being unreasonable. All my colleagues have family coming in to celebrate, and setting aside my family’s issues for one weekend shouldn’t be that difficult. Am I the asshole for forcing my family to come together, even though they all dislike each other?",,1,1,2,,,,
89,"I need some perspective on this.

I'm 30s (F) along with a group of 6 women started meeting about 2 times a month to talk about our careers, politics, and feminism. While we began to discuss our careers, we've also become friends who debate whether or not we could 'have it all' and how to balance ambition and family.

A while back, our friend brought an acquaintance ""Mandy"" to join and if I'm honest - I  became very annoyed by her. Mandy works at a dysfunctional job, supports her deadbeat boyfriend who treats her like a piggy bank, and seems to always be taken advantage of by her family, coworkers, and friends. Despite our constant encouragement, coaching, and job recommendations Mandy can't seem to set boundaries and advocate for herself or take our suggestion of therapy seriously. When one of us moderates the discussion to move on, Mandy will get teary eyed, baby voiced, and apologize for 'being a burden'.

It became a herculean effort for me to not snap at her when she did that.

A month ago, I sent out a group e-mail saying I can't make the group anymore due to time constraints and that I wish everyone the best. I am the first woman to decide to leave the group. One friend ""Kate"" reached out and in private I told her that it got to a point where I dread going and having to hear Mandy talk about how depressed she is and how nothing in her life is going well. Kate listened to me and confided that she also felt like she lacked compassion and was a 'bad feminist' for not being able to hold space for Mandy.

We made plans to hang out and when we did Kate showed up with everyone from the women's group except for Mandy. We've been meeting again, and to my understanding everyone just white lied about obligations to Mandy. Yesterday, I received a group e-mail from ""Mandy"" talking about how upset she was that the group disbanded and how she felt like she lost her only support system.

Am I the Asshole for excluded another Mandy from our informal women's group?

Edit: Not sure where the idea that we're an emotional support group stems from, but we're not a women's emotional support group. Our meetings are generally geared around navigating our professional careers and financial investments as women. None of us are licensed therapists.

I offered to buy fast food but he was really mad at me and treating me poorly over one small mistake. He had a 4hr shift and i was home all day. He said he was disappointed in me and that i had one thing to do. For some more context we spent the morning together till around 3:30pm and he left for work.

91,"I(21m) live at home with my brother(18m). One of the things that annoy me most is when people ask for something more than once. I read deep into it and see it as a mark on their character. I see it as rude and disrespectful to not accept someone's answer and ask again hoping for a new answer. Now if it's something playful and silly it's nbd. But in other circumstances it's one of the most annoying things to me. If I say no or hear someone say no and they reply with ""please"" or they ask again. My opinion on them changes drastically.

&amp;#x200B;

I work full time and go to school. Usually I work every weekend but last weekend I had the Saturday off so I was sleeping most of the day. Normally I get up every morning and make a breakfast with two eggs. I had just recently done my grocery shopping so I had two packs of eggs and a bunch of other food. I even sent out a group text to my family the night before to please not wake me but at 8AM I was rudely awakened by a phone call from my brother. He said he had three of his friends over(I guess they stayed the night) and he asked if he could use ""some"" of my eggs and, bacon, and other stuff to make pancakes. But seeing as there was 4 people. I knew ""some"" would be a week's worth of breakfast groceries for me. I told him no, hung up went back to sleep. I will put here that he tried to text me before calling but I wasn't answering. Then he calls again and asks if he can at least have eggs. I say no and mute my phone. My brother isn't the type to take food he didn't have permission to eat(I kinda terrorized him about that growing up if he ever ate my food without asking lol) Also he knows I work and pay for all my own food.

&amp;#x200B;

He knocks on my door and I am extremely pissed off at this point. We live 2 min from a convenience store. In the time he was whining to me he could have been back with breakfast food ready. I open the door and him and his friends are with him. The main reason I kind of feel bad is because this girl he likes was amongst his friends. He asks me again and says please. I just said ""come on man, don't be that guy that asks for things twice. Only losers do that. Don't be a fucking loser."" And just went back to sleep. I heard his friends giggling outside my door and teasing him about it. Did I go too far?",,3,3,3,,,,

 I don't mind giving her my laptop it's the fact I was screamed at then get told ""you should be available for your sister you can't keep locking your door to use we need you"" but the only reason I do is because they come into my room randomly looking through my room for anything and it's makes me so uncomfortable especially when my mom comes in to talk to me like I'm her therapist at 4am. I'm so tired and my mom says that I need to develop a routine where I wake up with my sister cause she could need me should I start doing that cause I just don't wanna be yelled at for my sister's poor planning anymore then get told my habits at waking up at 9 am are unhealthy.

94,"Well, this feels a bit petty. But, it would be nice to have unbiased opinions on the matter. So, here goes.

There are various tv shows that I (30M) love to catch up on in my free time. Because of that, I have just about every TV streaming service you could think of. I do share access to these services with my mom and sister. I have created profiles for them and there are no issues there. I also share these services with my best friend, (31M). We will call him Vee. 

Vee refuses to create and/or use his own profile on the streaming platforms. Instead, he uses mine. This is likely because I am the first profile at the top of the list. The issue here is that he and I enjoy many of the same shows. Often, I may pause or stop an episode in the middle of it in order to study, work or go to sleep. 

When Vee watches the same show on my profile, I lose my place and the next time I log in to watch, I have to figure out which episode I left off on and at which point. If he completes the show or movie, it also removes it from my ""Continue Watching"" feature altogether, which leaves me to search for the show AND THEN figure out where I left off. 

This has grown to be pretty frustrating when it happens regularly. Work can be pretty challenging at times and I do think this exacerbates the situation as I tend to use TV to decompress from work.

I have went as far as to create profiles for him and ask him several times to use it. But, I still come back to the same situation. So, WIBTA if I just changed my password altogether, locking him out?

**Why I may BTA:** Well I think I might BTA because this feels like his actions may be insignificant and my response may be inappropriate. It feels like it may be a childish thing to do.

TL;DR My best friend won't use his own profile on streaming networks and it leaves me to figure out where I left off.",,2,1,1,,,,
95,"I (32f) have five kids with my husband (33m) the ages of my kids are 10,8,7,5,and 5 (all girls). When the three oldest were little they were very close and would sneak Into each others rooms all of the time to sleep. After a while of this, me and my husband talked and we transferred our things into the second biggest bedroom and moved all of the kids beds and bedroom toys into the master bedroom. This has worked out well and has made bedtimes so much easier (ex, baths and bedtime stories) especially since the master has an attached bathroom so they can have a glass water at night without having to walk around the house. This was until my eldest daughters birthday, I didn’t want my daughters to think this had to be permanent and I want to encourage having a private space as they move into their teenage years so I told my daughter I would be giving her a room just to herself that would have her bed and her clothes(I’m still keeping a daybed in the other kids room for her because she requested it). I took her to a bunch of different stores and completely re-did a bedroom to make it just for her. The kids all seemed happy with this arrangement and I thought that this was the end. However, my younger sister (27f) has always made petty remarks about our bedroom situation and how she disapproves. This came to a head when she found out I had given the oldest her own room. She said I was favoring the oldest and that I am abusing my other kids by forcing them to be cramped in a room together and I need to put them all in their own room since I have the space. She has now gotten our parents on her side and I don’t know what to do because my sister has continued to call me selfish for “hoarding rooms” for myself but I feel like this was the best option for my family as it grows. I feel like I should separate all of the kids into their own bedrooms now because of the continuous texts I’ve now gotten from multiple family members. My friend told me to come here and share my story so Reddit AITA?

I also make sure that we have spaces around the house for my kids if they feel like they need to be alone and I encourage them to use them if they feel like they need to.

96,"I (27f) am engaged to my fiancé (27m) and our moms have been friends for many years, way before we got together.

Now for a little context and back story which matters on why I called them hypocrites.

I am autistic and suffer from multiple mental and physical health problems. Due to these issues I wasn't able to land a job until I was 24 and up until then my parents provided for me with no complaint.

My fiancé has a brother who's also on the spectrum and on a heavier scale than me. He's functioning but on occasions he has some outbursts and episodes which have cost him his career. So my in laws try to help him out as much as well and be supportive.

I've always felt guilty about my parents having to provide for me until I turned 24 but they assured me they do it because that's what loving and supportive parents do.

Here comes the hypocrisy part. Mil always judged my mom for providing for me until I was too old and said I'm too lazy to work and my mom is an idiot for still financially helping me. And my mom also judges my MIL for how she still ""babies"" her grown son instead of him just getting any regular job. Both my mom and mil call me and my brother in law pretentious for wanting to work on the field we studied in and got a degree for and call us lazy and ungrateful for picking and choosing what job to do. My MIL says it for me and my mom for my BIL. But of course each mom defends her own child when the other criticises.

I had enough of their bickering because in order to one up each other they always got us in the middle of arguments and putting us in awkward positions. So I called out their hypocrisy of how they can't critisise each other because at the end of the day they both did the same thing for their kids. I told my mom that if my MIL is a fool for providing whatever she can for her son then she's also a fool for providing for me and vice versa.

This ended up with both of them getting mad at me for pointing out their hypocrisy and my dad also called me ungrateful for using the help they provided for me against them to prove a point. This is really not what I was trying to do. I was just trying to get them to realise how silly their bickering is.",,2,1,1,,,,
97,"I (23F) work two full-time jobs at once to pay off immigration fees/lawyers. I work in construction and I’ve started a cleaning business on the side for some extra money. My boyfriend (24M) is a citizen. He doesn’t come from a rich family but he’s really good at saving money and has over $100k in cash/shares.

My car recently broke down and I told my boyfriend I was thinking about getting a personal loan of about $6000 to get a second-hand car. My boyfriend advised against this and insisted that I use my cash savings (about $3000) to buy a really shitty car. The problem is, I need a car big enough to carry equipment for my jobs, and I don’t want to spend money on a car that has lots of issues where I have to spend more money to fix it.

My boyfriend offered to lend me $2000. I then kinda yelled at him and told him that if the roles were reversed I would lend him all of money instantly (which is true by the way). He accused me of being emotionally manipulative. I just think $2000 is such a slap in the face when I know that he can afford more. AITA?

Edit: Just to clarify, the car I’d need is about $9000 so I’d be taking money from my savings too

My brother Josh has quite a big family, he and his ex-wife Mindy have 2 kids together, and his second wife Lisa has a daughter, Liz from their first marriage and 2 together with him.

Neither Liz and Lisa like me. I understand why Lisa might not like me but I don't know why Liz doesn't. I didn't want to spend money on people who hate me to come to my wedding so I didn't invite Liz or Lisa (It was clearly mentioned in the wedding invitation too).

Ever since my brother got the invitation he is upset I'm excluding a vital part of his family. He wants me to put Lisa and Liz on the guest list. He's also mad that Mindy and her family are on the list and they (Lisa and Liz) aren't. I don't want to do it because it'll mess up my budget, his family is already 1/8 of the guest list, and again they (Liz and Lisa) hate me. My parent's also think I'm being unfair and childish.

Edit: Forgot to add  The reason Mindy is invited is because she and I are very close. My brother and I have a huge age difference (I'm adopted btw) of 20 years and she was there for 10 years of my life (5-15). She is to me more like a sister than a SIL.

I told him he's free to decline the invite, but he doesn't want to and wants me to accommodate Lisa and Liz

 Lisa doesn't like because I'm very close to Mindy. I invite her(Mindy) to really important stuff (my 18 birthday, My College graduation, and a few of my birthdays (21 and 25)) and Lisa always complains and asks me to uninvite her and when I refuse she gets upset ",,2,2,3,,,,
99,"Ok apologies for the clickbaity title but that's literally what it is. 

I bought a house a year ago and living alone in a 3 bedroom house, I had plenty of room to spare. 

I have a pet snake, a ball python, she's full grown at 4.5 feet long. She's very lazy and chill, and mostly just lays around under the heat lamps in her tank. 

But when I bought the house, I decided to let her have the run of a room, since I had extra space. I sealed up the windows, door, vents, light fixtures, pretty much any crack she could try to squeeze through, and leave the top off her tank so she can roam around. I got some big pieces of driftwood and screwed them together to make basically a big cat tree for snakes, she loves climbing it and hanging out by the window. 

 Though a lot of the time she still lays in the tank since she likes the heat lamp. I've also got a few aquariums and terrariums in there with my octupus and lizards (all very well covered to keep the snake out lol) 

I've also got a sign on the door that says ""no step on snek"" (this one lol https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518gmSwLrvL.jpg) 

So with that context - I had a guy over my house for a hookup, we'd met at a bar, judge if you want lol but that was the situation. 

And for some reason he went upstairs to use the bathroom (I told him where it was) and after peeing went and opened the snake room door? I only noticed when I was downstairs getting us some waters, and he yelled from upstairs and slammed the door. 

He was yelling that there was a snake in my house and I called back that I knew, that was my snake, she's chill. He came downstairs screaming at me that I should of warned him, that I was a crazy (b word) for having a snake just out in a room that he thought was my bedroom.

I asked him why he was going thru my rooms anyway, I just said he could use my bathroom. He said he was looking for my bedroom because he assumed I'd meet him up there? But he was basically berating me for having a snake and not telling him. 

I said there was literally a sign saying the snake was there on the door, and he basically called me crazy again and walked out, saying I should have told him before he came over

I felt like I didn't need to since it's not like I would have brought him in there anyway and didn't think he'd just be going around looking in all the rooms? Like that's kinda weird...

AITA for not warning a guy about the snake room?",,2,1,1,,,,
100,"I (20M) had a lot of identity problems growing up, I grew up in a religious family that was very dismissive of the LGBT community so I couldn't count on anyone to explore these questions, so it was very difficult for me to accept who I was.

At the age of 16 years old I finally accepted that I was a trans man, it was not an easy thing to accept and I hated myself after that for being unnatural, but I had many good friends that supported me a lot and loved me with all their heart like a family. I finally told my mother I liked girls, she had a hard time accepting that, but with the time she was completely okay with that.

When I came out the closet as a trans man when I was 19, she straight told me that I was probably confused, that I was still young, a lot of negative and painful stuff, even today she still don't want to accept it, because of that we have a lot of fights everytime the topic came to light. In one of those conversations we decide to talk about it more calmly, but of course she didn't want to accept that I was sure about my choice, she got more mad when I told her I was gonna get some chest surgery, I snapped and told her ""I don't need your support, neither you acceptance, I don't care if the family likes it or not, this is my body not yours, my life not yours, I'm sure of my choice and I'm gonna do it you like it or not, the only thing I need for you is to be a mother and be there.""

After that, we just went silent and eat our food, but when I think about it maybe I was to hard in my words, maybe she's just scared and wants to protect me or maybe she just don't want to see it.

Am I the asshole?",2,2,1,,,,,
101,"Last Saturday, I (M16), had a soccer match that was out of our county. My team is U17, and I am the captain for it.

I play center back (defender) along with my teammate Ethan, the co-captain who is a solid defender and typically has a “let’s bounce back” type of mindset when things don’t go his way, and he’s sometimes defensive when he makes an error.

About 15 minutes before halftime, it was still 0-0. It was our goal kick and I normally take them. Sometimes Ethan and I alternate in who takes them, but I take most of them. 

I let Ethan take the goal kick, and it barely comes off the ground and goes right to their striker, who I sprinted to and defended. But he passed it back to his midfielder, and hit it first-time and it went in. 

I was incredibly annoyed at this, and Ethan looked distraught. As soon as we kicked off, Ethan started moping and pouting, and it was obvious he was not putting in his maximum effort. I had to pick up his slack, and it pissed me off that he seemed to give up after making one mistake, which I thought was a joke because I'm not one to have this pessimistic mindset and give up whenever something goes wrong.

At halftime, Ethan started kicking our guys water bottles and started swearing, and I told Ethan he couldn't disintegrate after making one mistake and to stop moping (in front of the team), to which he told me to stfu and that he wasn't moping. 

During the second half, he played a lot more fierce and determined, and I feel like me calling him out motivated him to prove me wrong, and he wasn't moping anymore,

Sadly we lost 0-1  but we ended up playing very well towards the end. I was still frustrated with the whole match, and I vented this to our goalkeeper, saying that it was such a dumb goal to concede and the refereeing was awful. Our goalie understood and acknowledged Ethan’s improved performance in the second half, and he was also disappointed to have not gotten the win. 

After the final whistle, I was also feeling a bit guilty about having called Ethan out in front of the team. I apologized to him and he said it was all good, and he said “my bad for the goal kick, that won't happen again”. 

I thought we were good after that, but two of my other teammates came up to me after the game and told me that what I did t Ethan at halftime was pretty fucked and need to learn how to control my anger. One of them also said that I have a power trip from being captain, and it doesn’t give me the right to embarrass my other teammates and yell at people when I want. This confused me because I don’t make a big deal about being captain, and I don’t yell at my teammates just to be an asshole.

 I think that the teammates who are against me here just think this because they never communicate in games, and I never hear their voices on the field.

Am I the asshole here? I feel like what I did to Ethan might have been a little harsh in the moment, but it helped him pick himself back up and I apologized.",2,1,2,,,,,
102,"So I (17F) have been trying to ask my mom to get me a diagnosis for the longest time (ADHD and Autism at minimum). I am aware that my research might be false and I might not actually have them, but I am almost 100% sure I do (I've put days into researching this because I have a fear of rejection, I am female, I want to be informed on the subject so I don't get treated like I'm dumb, and I hyper fixated on it for a couple weeks).  


Now, I mentioned to my mom (39F) that I wanted to get diagnosed and she just sighed at me. This wasn't the reaction I was expecting because she's usually pretty accepting about this kind of stuff. We talked about it and she asked if it was just okay that she knew I had ADHD (I never brought up the autism) and I said that ADHD is something I really want to talk to someone about and get help for. She said maybe and we've talked about it maybe 10 times in the past two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Well yesterday, I finally brought it up again (And also brought up the autism) because she said we have a doctor's appointment soon and I asked if we could bring it up. This started a whole new argument and she said that she doesn't want me to get diagnosed because she believes it'll make people think of me worse especially when I'm travelling to places or trying to get a job. I said I almost didn't care about that because I'm almost 18 and that'll make getting a diagnosis worse and more expensive and she said she'll look into it again. Every time she's said that, it's never been true and I've always been the one to bring it up so I told her that and she got mad. I accused her of just not wanting a daughter with these diagnosis's and she said that that's not true. I asked if it was money then and she said nothing is the problem she just doesn't think it's right for me to get them.

&amp;#x200B;

I just left and have accepted the fact that I was probably not going to be able to bring it up at the doctor's appointment, but my mom came to me defeated and said that I was allowed to bring it up and ask the doctor and it made me feel really bad. I talked to my friend and he said that the whole thing was just dumb and I shouldn't have made an argument and just waited till I was 18, but idk. AITA?",1,1,1,,,,,
103,"I (f 18) had an exam yesterday at a place 2 hours away from my house. I agreed to go out with a guy (m 22) for a date. We've gone out once before too, and I found him cool. My parents don't let me out of my house because I'm grounded, and especially not on a date. He knows about this and still is okay with it.

 My exam finished at 5 20 pm. We had agreed to meet at 5 45 the day prior. I understand he might be busy, so I asked him several times whether it was okay and he said yes. Well, I walked to the station and stood there for an hour waiting. I'd given him a precise location and mentioned my battery was low. My phone died by 6 15, so I couldn't even text him. I got really pissed at the time and went home dejected and tired from the exam. Also, I hadn't eaten since 8 am because the exam was lengthy and I had no time between travelling. I was really looking forward to enjoying a McDonalds burger with him but he wasn't there. I reached home at 9, and (ik it's not his fault) I was catcalled on the way and it made me feel bad I waited so long for no reason.

My phone hung and started directly in the morning, so I couldn't text him at all during the night. I woke up late in the morning and switched on my phone. He had texted me at 6 20 that he was there and we hadn't seen each other. He wasn't at all angry, just really concerned and checking up if I was okay. I felt really guilty for being angry (though I didn't tell him) and feel bad that I left, but I really needed to get home. 

AITA?

For context, I have a really crappy phone from 2015.",2,1,1,,,,,
104,"I had a LDR for less than a year. Following ex's advice, we met for phone chat sessions around three times a week. At first, they were for two hours, but then they got shorten as she got busy.

She told me that due to her cultural values, she is very loyal to her family. After she dropped out of college while being jobless, she became busier since her mother required her to deep clean the house daily, and we had little time to communicate. If guests came or her mother needed groceries, the ex had to drop our conversations immediately. She told her she already spend all free time with me, even she had 5 minutes, she’s texting me. She also had depression and was always emotionally and physically exhausted without telling me reasons in detail.

Once, she canceled our video chats last minute because of guests. It was our first argument, and I told her that I would appreciate it if she told me beforehand since she knew the guests would come, and she told me, ""I don't see how since I'm crying my eyes out."" She felt depressed again yesterday. I told her this only takes 10 seconds.

After a month or so, her cancellations got worse, and I'd get a 20-minute chat a week if I'm lucky. This is our second argument: there was once where she canceled chats three or four times in a row, and I got bothered. I told her, ""the average couple spends two hours a day together. I'm wondering how much time do you want to spend together?"" and ""we spend around two hours together a week."" I recalled the last message for being harsh, but she told me she saw it, and I was lying. I told her you could reread our texts and they took 2 hours. She was pissed, painted herself as a responsible family person, and me as selfish, only taking care of myself, and only seeking attention. I told her I have a company to run as my day job. She told me that I was still complaining even she already told me to cancel beforehand and I knew the reason: guests, cleaning, groceries, etc. She wasn't going to entertain me and leaving her grandmother to die. I tried to apologize and comfort her, but she wanted to break up. She said we'll wait for a month, but she already knew how it would turn out. Later, she told me that her ill grandmother had to call an ambulance. All she wanted was a bit of patience. I told her we should call once a week, and she said twice because even she thought once is too little.

In the following month, I didn't dare to call or text her. I kept myself careful. I asked for a ten-minute call on Valentine's Day, but she canceled on the same day because she had to shop for her mother. I didn’t say anything this time. We didn’t call this month at all. After this month, I found myself blocked, and I hadn't heard from her until today.

AITA for being too confrontational? Should I be more patient to make this work? I was angry and didn't feel like a priority or being respected, but am I losing respect or seeking too much attention?",2,2,1,,,,,
105,"I realize this is petty af, just saying.

I have a friend “C” who is extremely loyal and generally wonderful, however is also very possessive of me and our friendship. This has led to several points of contention in regard to my other close friends. She has zero interest in being friends with my other friends which is fine, it just makes social gatherings awkward because she is unable to hide her jealousy.

Recently she told me that my other best friend “E” blocked her on Facebook. I was pretty taken aback because E is not the petty dramatic type. C was adamant that E blocked her but she asked me not to ask E about it.

I really wanted to clear the air so I told E that I noticed her and C weren’t friends anymore to see what she would say. E was clear that she never unfriended her as she had no reason to. She genuinely liked C.

I told C that E didn’t unfriend her and C went absolutely apeshit, calling E a liar, untrustworthy, accused E of coaching her kids to hate C, told E that her kids can ‘fuck off,’ among other insults. She blamed me for starting this drama, and yet I feel like her reaction is her own doing. I genuinely wanted to clear the air, but C is now ignoring me.

This is the second close friend of mine that C refuses to talk to for (in my mind) made up grievances.

106," Some context - This is not my blood sibling, it is my best friends little brother. I am close with the family as i have been for years. Recently the youngest brother (15 at the time 16 now,) had been told by his farther he had to move out. I took him in to my house and financially supported him til he managed to aquire a benefit to help towards bills ect.  
He doesn't help around the house unless forced and I found out a little while after taking him in he had been stealing of off my partner and myself, only little things but stealing is stealing. At the time I was angry and told him to find other arrangements to live, however he didn't really try hard and found nowhere.  
Upon this happening I gave him a second chance. The chance included a list of basic rules to adhere to, contributing to the house cleaning, times to turn his tele off at night so he isn't using power all night, no stealing ect;  
Since this he has failed to follow majority of the rules, including still taking things without asking, (I smoke which is legal in my state and he has been stealing little amounts on the regular, which I don't mind giving it to him he has an addiction that we are trying to squash, but its the fact he doesn't ask just takes then won't mention it unless called out.)  
So I'm thinking of telling him he has to find somewhere else to live, I work full-time as does my partner and we are having to lock doors and have safes in our own house. I also feel that by allowing him to stay after blatantly and purposefully breaking rules that I will just be encouraging the behaviour. Neither of his parents want to take him in even though his farther is in a position where he has extra rooms at the house, the finances to be able to ect and they are all guilting me into letting him stay which is why i gave him the chance the first time. It's causing unnecessary stress in my household between me and my partner and stress in general as I am cleaning up my mess, my partners and now his even though he is at home all day everyday.  
So reddit would I be the asshole if I told him he needs to find other living arrangements over the nect 6 weeks and would I be the asshole if last time repeats itself and he makes no effort and ends up with nowhere and I still kicked him out?",1,1,1,,,,,
107,"My best friend and I have known each other since the 4th grade and are now in our early 30s. I've met all of his girlfriends in the past, but they've always ended pretty badly soon after they realize his best friend (me) is a female. Apparently, there's this unspoken rule that says the opposite sex can't be ""Just Friends."" His last girlfriend dispised me so much that she would call me his other wife whenever she could. I always showed his girlfriends love and respect because they are the people my best friend has feelings for. I've always made sure not to overstep boundaries that would make them uncomfortable (i.e., calling when I know they're together or calling during ""booty call hours""). I should also mention that he and I briefly dated in high school, and by briefly, I mean 2 months. I've told him he should be honest with them in that aspect before they find out on their own, but sometimes it's okay to tell a little white lie. His last girlfriend expressed to me once that she wanted the same relationship he and I have. I kindly reminded her that he and I like the same thing: Women, and that she should want something more intimate than the brother/sister relationship we have. Long story short, he's currently in a new relationship. They've been dating for 3 months now, and he wants me to meet her. I'm not ready to meet her just yet, given how badly his last girlfriend reacted. He says she's different, but he's said that about the previous girlfriends, and they've all known from the start that I'm GAY or the proper term, a lesbian. Yet they have always made me uncomfortable being the ""lesbian"" best friend, assuming there was more between us than we let on. I'm not saying I don't want to meet her at all, I just feel like a little more time is needed, and maybe we start off smaller like social media adds or something. I've expressed this to him, but he's laughed it off as me overthinking thinks. AITA?",1,1,1,,,,,
108,"I (33M) have been working at a company for around 5 years.  I was recently promoted to supervisor in a department of 25 other engineers.  I am one of the highest-performing employees in the department, and at work, I’m also one of the most social.  I’m an introvert, but I am OK at “playing the game” within the confines of work and I genuinely enjoy being around many of my coworkers.  Due to other employees’ lack of initiative, it usually falls to me to plan the social outings, which are normally at a bar or bowling alley or something.  Only around half of my coworkers have kids, and most of them are younger than mine and there are only a few.  I drive ~35 minutes to work, which is farther than most of my coworkers (I don’t mind this).

I have a wife and 3 kids, ages 4, 10, and 14.  I value separation between work and home life intensely, and I leave exactly at 4:00 pretty much every day.  I normally come in around 6:30 and work through lunch, which might not necessarily be healthy, but it’s the way I balance things out.  My wife is more introverted than I am and not comfortable talking a lot to people she doesn't know. English is also her second language.  We generally try to avoid social events where we can’t blend in with the crowd, but if it’s something related to the kids we oblige for their sake and we do alright.

Up until now, during my time at the company, we have never had a work event on a weekend, or where family was included.  My boss has mentioned a few times that he and his wife would like to hang out with me and my wife outside of work.  This has never gone too far so I’ve always been able to play it off (Covid helped).  My wife has made it clear she is not interested in this.

At a supervisor’s meeting today, my boss said he was organizing an event for a Saturday next month at a local park.  There are walking trails and a picnic area at the park, and he’ll be providing hot dogs and drinks.  He mentioned that families are invited, and after saying that, he looked at me and said “I expect your family to be there.”  I was unprepared for how direct this was, and blurted out “there’s no fucking way they’re coming.”  He guilt tripped me after that, saying “what do I need to do, hand-deliver an invitation?” and some other things like that.  I was pretty angry and don’t remember most of the specifics.  After some arguing I said I’d try to bring my youngest child and the matter died, but it really offended me and I was fuming the rest of the day.

I have some issues doing anything work-related on the weekend, but I think it’s really unfair to put me on the spot for my family not wanting to attend.  If he had asked in a different way, or just let the event play out, I might approach it differently, but as it stands I’m digging my heels in and ready to fight back if it comes up again.

110,"I wanted to go to a play that was at my school with a couple of friends. We planned on going to Dominoes beforehand but I didn’t tell my dad and step mom about until the day of the play. They said that it would be dangerous to go to Dominoes since it would be dark around that time (which it wasn’t). They called my mom to see if she would agree with them and she did. Even though the Dominoes is only across the street from my school they still thought it was dangerous.

When I got to school I walked in and snapped my friends a picture of me in the school. They immediately texted me to go to Dominoes but I said that I would get in trouble if I did. I still walked out of the school and met with one of my friends in front of the school. She tried convincing me to go with her into the Dominoes. But like I said, I didn’t wanna get in trouble. So I just went on the sidewalk with her and waved at my friends who were in the Dominoes. I stayed on the sidewalk of my school until my friends came out of the Dominoes. After that we walked back into the school and went into the auditorium to sit down to watch the play. After the intermission started, my dad texting me asking if the play was over and I said we were only in the intermission, my dad texting me again saying that he already sees people walking out and to get my butt to the car. I started getting pretty sad because I was having a really good time with my friends but I knew that I couldn’t disobey my dad so I said goodbye to my friends and I walked to the car. 

As soon as I got into the car, they started saying that I disobeyed their trust, and that they didn’t know if they could let me do stuff with my friends again. I got super confused and I asked him what I did wrong and they said that my stepmom saw me “going” to the Dominoes. Even though I didn’t, which is already one lie. My dad then started talking about how dangerous it is for teenage girls like me to be walking around and then he made my stepmom tell me a story about how she got run over by a car while crossing the road when she was sneaking out even though it doesn’t apply to me because I wasn’t on the road at all. Then he asked me if I knew what type of ladies stand on the side of the road and I asked what type of ladies and he said prostitutes, he followed up by saying “oh, I’m not calling you a prostitute.” But if he wasn’t calling me a prostitute, then why would he bring that up in the first place? Then he said that he knows that I didn’t cross the street but he also knows how a “ teenagers mind” works. So I basically got fussed at because of something they thought I would do even though I didn’t do it.",1,1,2,,,,,
111,"On Friday after my workout I was on FaceTime with my girlfriend. After my shower I was brushing my teeth and other hygiene stuff. Out of nowhere she says something like “put some clothes on you still look tiny” and I said if I’m skinny then she is fat. We are both pretty much the opposite of those things so obviously they were jokes. Even though both jokes were ass I at least gave her a little ahhaha before I said what I said. What do I get for my joke??? Called childish and Blocked. Literally until a couple hours ago I was blocked the whole weekend.

So now today we were on our way to our first period class and she was ignoring me and wouldn’t talk to me in the hallway. When we got in the classroom she goes and tells the teacher that I’m harassing her. The teacher sends me to the office and she literal smirks at me on my way out while the teacher is calling the office so I know she was being petty.

I’m in the office and the principal and counselor are giving me this pointless ass lecture trying to make it seem like I was creeping on her or something. Anyway I had in school suspension(ISS) and detention after school for today. 

She unblocked me and said if I had apologized she wouldn’t be mad anymore and it wasn’t actually what I said it was how I said it. I left her on read because I had no idea wtf she was talking abt at the end that doesn’t even make sense and I will admit that I was kinda in my feelings about the whole harassing thing. Anyway, I came here because when I was telling my boys I got nothing but horrible takes and the advice was even worse. It was so bad that I literally left the gc.

112,"Okay so I (F20) am writing this on behalf of my parents (M&amp;F 50) because they don't use reddit but they would like people's opinion on this situation. For the sake of this post I (the daughter) will refer to myself as ""Daisy"".

From this point on is my parent's POV:

Our family friend's daughter ""Patricia"" (F23) is getting married in July. We've known Patricia and her family since she was around 8 years old. Anytime we would see them at gatherings, Patricia and Daisy (as well as the other girls around their age) would always hang out/play together. The girls have essentially all grown up together.

When Patricia turned 15, she had her Quinceñera. Daisy was 11 at the time and was not invited because she was ""too young"", however our other family friend's daughters (both 12) **were** invited. We decided to not make a big deal of it and accepted the fact that they viewed Daisy as being too young, but of course it did upset us a bit that the other girls, only a year older than Daisy, were invited. 

Since then we've still been friends with Patricia and her parents, there's never been any ""bad blood"" between us, it's always been very cordial. When Daisy turned 15, she wanted a very small gathering so we **did not** invite Patricia and her parents, but it doesn't seem like they've held a grudge because of that in any way considering they were on vacation when Daisy's party occured.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago when the wedding invitations were sent out. Our invitation clearly stated it was only for two people so we assumed that Patricia and her fiancé were only inviting  couples to the wedding. That's until we spoke to our family friends (their daughters are around Daisy's age,  two 21 year olds and a 19 year old) and **all 3 were invited**. We would say that these family friends are at that same level of ""closeness"" with Patricia and her family, so it's not a matter of them being ""closer"" to the family. 

When we told Daisy that she wasn't invited but the other girls were, she was a bit upset. She felt like it was the Quinceñera situation all over again and she was confused as to why she was excluded **again**. Daisy has always viewed Patricia like an ""older cousin"" and there's never been any issues between them. 

So all this leads to us wondering if we would be the assholes for going/not going. We feel sad for our daughter Daisy that she's being excluded but we feel as though if we don't go to the wedding as a sign of ""retaliation"", people are going to start talking and we need an excuse as to why we ""can't go"" to the wedding. The same would probably happen if we **did** go to the wedding, people would start asking why Daisy isn't there when all the other girls that she grew up with **are there.**

Would we be the assholes for not going/ or for going?",None,2,1,,,,,
113,"My bf(25M) and I (27F) have been together for a year. For reasons, my bf was unable to go to college when he was younger. When we met, I helped him enroll into community college since he expressed a desire to go. I promised that I would help him through his school journey as much as I possibly could. 

So far in the one year he has been in school, I have picked his classes every semester, done his financial aid, applied for him a loan to cover the cost until the scholarship I also applied for on his behalf came through, helped him take midterms and finals because he has bad test taking anxiety, took two winter online courses for him so he could focus on a very difficult math class…

It was time to pick classes again last week. So I logged on and picked his classes. It would not allow me to enroll in a class that he needs and I wasn’t sure why. So I was like “hey. You need to go to an advisor. “ I made him the appointment for the advisor. Which was through email. 

So the day comes for the appointment, I was on the phone with my friend.

The advisor emailed that he didn’t have the requirement for the class and offered him alternative options.  He immediately started freaking out and asked me to end my call so I could call him and explain it to him. I said no. And he began flipping out and cursing out my friends/family who he feels I prioritize over him

I did not want to end my call because I was enjoying my conversation with my friend and I felt that the advisor was better equipped (and getting paid) to deal with his issue than me. All the answers and explanations he needed could be easily gotten from the advisor with who he had an appointment with, I haven’t been in school in almost ten years, everything is different. I had to teach myself how to do everything when doing it for him. I don’t understand why he cannot do the same. Millions of people go to college, without anyone’s help, and they utilize the resources at their hand like the advisors to learn what is required. I also feel like my boyfriend expects way too much of me and everytime I help him, a little favor becomes a huge responsibility on my back. Which isn’t fair to me. When I offered to help him through school, I thought I would teach him how to do things and he would take over. He does not understand why I am unwilling to take on the stress and responsibility of his school any more than I already have. 

His point of view is that I offered to help him in the beginning and he wouldn’t have gone to school if I didn’t offer to help. He also feels like I have no issue helping my friends and family and go above and beyond for them and not for him. He also feels like when I do help, I throw it in his face and that I make him feel like he does nothing for me when he “has spent hours speaking to you, been patient with you, buying you chocolate and candy, and taking you out”

116,"throwaway account

So I (18F) graduate HS in 2 weeks.

In March I suggested to C (17F) and A (18F) that we go on a trip to Disney, just the 3 of us, no parents, so we can celebrate and have some fun. Both A and C said that was a great idea.

We end up deciding to go to Universal instead. We live in Florida, so it’s not a problem for us. C’s mom is okay with our plan but doesn’t want us to go to Universal, but eventually gives C the okay. A and C’s families have annual passes to Universal and Disney respectively, so they prefer the park they have passes for.

I tell A and C we need to make some more concrete plans but I’m dismissed a few times until they relent and I get a text from A in the group chat. A says that her dad is booking a 2 bedroom suite and told us the dates. It’s 2 days after graduation. My grandma is flying into town for it, and so that’s a conflict for me. I ask to change the dates and A says no because they can’t get a suite for other days but I did get the dates changed to 3 days after instead. Still not very good since grandma will be here, but it’s the only way my parents will sign off on it.

Saturday C asked about the itinerary, A says we’re leaving for the parks very early, staying the whole day, and getting up “ridiculously early” (her words, not mine) to do it again, and get home really late. I objected and said no to rope dropping, we’ll be tired from the first day and the heat will only make it worse. Even C agreed with me and she likes rope dropping at theme parks, but we still got denied.

It bothered me enough that I told my parents at lunch about it and the suite. They told me to ask about the suite because it was weird to rent a 2 bedroom suite for 3 of us, and I agreed. I text the group chat and then get a private response from C saying that it’s for A’s family, and that both of their parents talked about it or something. Then A texts confirming her family is coming. At this point I’m uncomfortable, the whole point of the trip was for us 3 to celebrate graduating and becoming adults, and everyone’s families were okay with it being just us. Now it’s A’s family vacation with me and C as guests, and I know that’ll feel awkward. And I’m also a bit bitter that C and A discussed it without telling me anything, had I not asked then I wouldn’t have found out until the day of. Even if they say we’ll be on our own in the parks, we’ll be in the same room, go to and from the parks together, and eat meals together. 

Now I don’t want to go anymore, it’s not what I agreed to and even my parents are annoyed that the other families discussed without them. They said I don’t have to go if I don’t want to since we haven’t bought a ticket. But I know C would pull out too if I did, and I wouldn’t want to ruin it for her or A. And I don’t really want to go if I won’t have a lot of fun, especially since my grandma will be in town. WIBTA if I pulled out?",2,1,1,,,,,

This cruise is happening a week after my boyfriend’s internship ends after him working the whole summer, so we thought why not book a trip? We booked a trip to Europe from August 15-22. My mom is leaving August 18-20 (only 3 days!!) 

I booked this trip last month and didn’t mention it to her because my bf and I also went to Europe last summer for 3.5 weeks and had a great time. I randomly told her today because it came up in conversation and she flipped out. She told me to start saving up $$$ to move out, said I’m extremely disrespectful for not telling her around of time, and to cancel my trip or to get my money back somehow. Important to note that my mom is very strict and has been all my life, but as of the last few years she has been a little better. She still has her moments. 

I obviously am extremely upset and don’t know what to do if I’m the bad guy in this situation. She is mainly upset because now, my brother (15) and my sister (18) are going to need to have someone to watch them for that weekend since I won’t be here. Her and my dad divorced years ago and she doesn’t want my dad to “babysit” my siblings because she hates him…

I don’t know if I’m AITA in this situation for not telling her, but I don’t want to live my life based on who’s babysitting my siblings and I’m also turning 21 in a few weeks and the trip is fully paid for on my own, all I did was book it the same weekend she’s leaving because that’s when my boyfriends summer internship ends

118,"My sister (36f) and I (31f) have always been very close, she’s my best friend. She recently left her husband for her best friend (40 something f). Friend and I have bad blood. We used to work together and were friends but I quickly learned how toxic she is (lazy, problems with authority, lack of accountability, intimidating, made people feel bad for working hard). I asked my supervisor to have me moved so I didn’t have to work with her anymore. 

She found out and saw me as a snitch. Turned a lot of people against me. 

I didn’t bring my sister into it because I respected their friendship. But she knew how hurt I was by this.

About a year went by and the friend lost someone close to her tragically, and her wife had filed for divorce. Having been her friend, I knew how hurt she must have been so reached out to offer condolences and to apologize for the misunderstanding, and she accepted but it was still awkward. This isn’t someone I wanted in my life though, so I just moved on and was happy that we could be civil when we had to see each other. 

Few months later, my sister leaves her loveless marriage (together for about 10 years, married for about 3). This needed to happen. She moved in with her best friend of course. A few weeks go by and I hear a rumor at work that they’re more than friends. My sister confirms it, expressed her worry because of the awkwardness between the friend and me and didn’t want anything to come between us. I told her I was worried they were moving fast, possibly rebounding, but I was happy if she was happy. 

Next day our mother dies of lung cancer and I’m still absolutely gutted. And my sister wasn’t there for me because she was busy with her new relationship. Things changed and something definitely came between us, so my feelings about it all quickly turned sour. I was always honest with my sister about my feelings, but made it clear I wasn’t asking her to choose but to maybe consider me a bit more. I was feeling left behind and I was in a really dark place, no immediate family left. 

Then she texts me one night saying she proposed and the friend said yes. I was devastated. I knew it would hurt her that I wasn’t feeling happy for her but I responded with my concerns. Her divorce wasn’t final yet and I was concerned with how fast this was going. Only 6 months of dating. She didn’t respond. But the friend texted me the next day with this long nasty message basically saying I’m shitty and selfish for not jumping for joy. I asked her to please leave it between my sister and me and that I was only looking out for her. She came back with more personal attacks. When I told my sister, she defended the friend and that really stung. We fought. Eventually I agreed to try and work things out with the friend for my sisters sake and was rejected and insulted further. 

AITA for definitely not supporting it now?",2,2,1,,,,,
119,"Me (M23) and my boyfriend (M22) live together for 2 years now and the relationship is going strong. I really love my boyfriend, he is te world to me but as I am writing this, I question if it is all still worth it. 

My boyfriend is a gamer, he loves to play online games with his friends via Discord. He has his own room where his pc is. Sometimes he stays up late, let's say till 3 am. I don't really mind that because he often doesn't game with his friend and we stay up late watching movies and just be together. A couple of months ago me and my bf watched a movie and I wend to sleep and he told me he would game for a short while and than join me in bed. I think I waited 2 hours for him, keep in mind that I went to bed at midnight. When I woke up he still wasn't in bed. I went to his game room and I found him still gaming. I confronted him and we had a small fight about it. In the end he told me that this wouldn't happen again. Fast forward to a couple of days ago. 

A couple of days ago was our 3 year anniversary. I had cooked a nice romantic dinner for us and after dinner we watched out favorite movie together. Again around midnight I told him that I wanted to sleep and we told me that he would stay for a little while and finish the tv show that he was watching. So I went to bed and lit some candles to make a romantic scene. I waited for half an hour when I decided to go check on him, an episode normally takes 30 minutes and he told me he was halfway. The living room was empty even the bathroom was empty. So I went to his game room and I found him there, gaming with his friends. I just glared at him and went to bed. Not long after he joined me and tried to apologize. 

The next morning when I was eating breakfast he joined me and asked me if I wanted to talk about last night. I asked him if he could spend less time gaming. He got mad at me saying that I was being selfish and that it wasn't fair to ask him that. I think it is not that unfair of me to ask him that. I really feel like I am going to loose him if he keep doing this. But I am not sure, maybe he is right. So AITA?

Update:

Thank you all for your help. I talked to him about how I felt. I also told him that it's not my intention to control his gaming and that I will be more explicit if I wanted some quality time in bed.",1,2,1,,,,,
120,"My spouse and I bought a box of office supplies on sale. His father observed this big box and asked if he could have some supplies. Then he asked again. Then he asked again. Then he asked again. My spouse would sell his dad a bundle of supplies and pocket the money. So, I ""hid"" our supply. Now I feel like I'm being petty but there are just so many examples like this. When my spouse asked why I hid the supplies, I told him the truth. This is not a one off type of behaviour for my spouse. Does this make me the asshole?",2,2,2,,,,,
121,"I (27f) have a sister, Amy (31f). Amy and her husband Bob (33m) have been having marital issues for a while now mostly due to Bob’s job. He has a high profile and demanding job in our area and he often works so much that he’s never really home all that much. It’s been like this for around 3 years now. This is a problem not only for their marriage in general but also because they have my wonderful nieces who are triplets (all 4f). 

I moved in with them after my undergrad 2 years ago because I was going to grad school in their city and my sister really wanted me to live with them, and my BIL agreed. He was already gone most of the time by this point and so I naturally helped my sister out a lot with childcare. This continued even after I got a job and started a phd. I do a lot of babysitting, bath times, mealtimes and bedtimes and they recently started school so Amy and I share taking them to school. Sometimes I feel like Amy and I are parents and Bob is more like that uncle who occasionally visits. But when he’s home they always fight and a few months ago they decided to trial separate. They still live together, though in separate rooms. If I’m honest it feels like not much is different. 

A few days ago Bob did make it home for dinner, and when he came home I was sitting at the table talking to them when one of the girls handed me a letter from the school detailing an upcoming parent’s information evening and asked Amy if I would be going too, Amy didn’t reply because one of the other girls asked which story I would be reading for bedtime. Bob overheard everything.

He waited til the girls were asleep and blew up at Amy. How dare she let me have such an active part in parenting the kids etc. and she blew up back she wouldn’t need help parenting if he were there etc. They both tried to get me involved, and asked me if I had a side. I said while I do (Amy) I think that it’s something that was better talked about when the girls were gone and they were calmer, and suggested talking about it the next day. Bob is upset about the whole thing, and Amy is hurt I didn’t side with her immediately because she knows I agree. Idk what to do here. AITA?

ETA: I think it should be made clear that I obviously won’t be going to the parent thing, as I’m not a parent. And that my nieces know I’m not their mother, I’m their aunt. They’re just used to Bob not being there and Amy and I doing lots of things with them.",1,1,1,,,,,
122,"Okay, so storytime is here, but first some basic info you'll need.

1. I'm [26] never one to speak up a lot, I usually keep my opinions to myself.
2. My brother [23] is a bit more direct. We both still live at home btw.

So, he [my brother] was dating this girl for a few months, they said the loved each other but at some point it turned into a shitshow. One day me and him go to the gym together where I see this really cute girl and on the way out I tell him ""wow, that girl is really cute!"". 
Fast-forward to one week later, my brother and his by then ex-gf have broken up for the third time, this time it turned out to be definitive. I go to the gym again and talk to that previously mentioned cute girl a little bit and decide to send her a follow request on IG, which was accepted and reciprocated. I get home to my brother smiling and being cheerful (which was unexpected after his breakup). It turned out that he had sent the same aforementioned cute girl a DM and was now talking to her quite a bit. Bummer for me ofcourse since I was planning on sending her a DM too.
Fast forward to today.
My brother and the cute girl are starting to date and he shoots me a text while I'm at work. He asks me, in somewhat vague wording, whether my dad, him and I were going out for dinner some time this week. I tell him that I'd love that.
Well it turns out he didn't actually mean the three of us, but rather just my dad and me. This way he'd have the house to himself for a date night with the cute girl. When he told me that he wasn't in fact coming along because he wanted a date night, I told him well now I don't know if I want to come (my dad and I have a very basic relationship where we don't really do stuff together or anything, so I wasn't really feeling that). 
Now my brother is mad at me for not wanting to go out and leaving him alone with cute girl, saying he's having to cancel a lot of his plans.
So, am I the asshole?

P.s I should add I did have plans for Friday night prior to this whole thing to meet up with friends on Discord and discuss our vacation plans for the summer. Getting everyone online at the same time was no easy task either",1,1,1,,,,,
123,"Me and my guy best friend have been friends forever, like 6+ years. I have always told him we will never be more than friends because I see him as a brother. He also said the same thing, that he doesn’t see me like that.  I just recently started talking to this one kid and my guy best friend is pressedddd. He says I can’t talk about him, can’t post him, or tell him anything about this kid. He removed himself from my private story because I posted a picture of me and the kid. He has never had this problem with anyone else who I have been attracted too, and whenever he finds girls to talk to, he can come to me? Am I the asshole?",1,1,1,,,,,
124,"The dynamics are complicated but J (late 50s F) is my dad’s GF of almost 12 yrs. They are not married, have separated houses and don’t share finances. 

My brother and I (both early 20s, students) try to go somewhere for a few days with our dad once/yr and J comes with. Last vacation as a surprise she bought tickets to a show for everyone which was really nice of her. I did not know at the time but they were quite expensive $100-150 each. My brother and I talked about it and we covered the meal/drinks and an activity beforehand (over $300 for everyone). After the show we thanked her. 

Recently she made a comment about how she’ll never do that again and how my brother and I are ungrateful. For context, she and my brother don’t have the best relationship and she did not particularly care for the activity, but was initially wanting to go. Also on these trips, my dad pays everything for her. Airbnb got split 3 ways and meals get split 1/2 to Dad, 1/4 each to me and brother. This sounds relatively fair except usually my brother or I sleep on a couch and J drinks very expensive scotch and tequila. 

Not everything should be tit for tat, but I thought my brother and I were reasonable and polite. Did I do something wrong?",1,1,1,,,,,

Why you be walking around Walmart being so slow talking to people but you're able to text me just fine. I'm just curious 
Do you really have a disability??? 
Nah we just figured it out. That's why you got moved to custodian/maintenence 
Nah dude I would tell you something... And you'd just go back in your own little world 
They gonna fire you again if they give you a second chance. You need to cut the act out. 
Obviously you're not retarded. You can speak and text fine 
They're just gonna think you're on drugs 
You gotta cut out whatever it is you're doing 
No I'm not disabled. Do you see me walking around looking lost like you did? 
Yeah I am. And it's not just me. There's a lot of other people thinking you're faking 
Yiu gotta stop that shit 
Call xxxxx behavioral health 
They'll help you 
To not have to work hard. Disability checks. Sympathy. Bro there's lots of reasons you could be doing that 
If you're not faking it. Then next time you come back to Walmart you need to work like everyone else 
That shits mad weird yo 
How is it fake? Cuz you've been playing everyone like you're mentally handicapped... But you ain't??? 
Yeah I don't when people cheat the system 
So you've just been faking the whole time 
Damn me n some other people knew you were faking 
I ain't got time for this bro 
You're obviously not disabled.. You're just loony 
Take care bro. Please get help

127,"This weekend, my parents and my sister were going out of state but I wanted to stay home so I could study for AP exams. My parents were fine with that but they didn't want me to spend the night alone so they arranged for me to spend the night at my friend's house (we'll call her Ava) in another town. They told me that her dad would pick me up at 8 and that I should give them this king-sized chocolate bar as a thank you.

Well, her dad showed up before 8 so I was packing in a rush and forgot the bar, even though my parents reminded me 3 times. I didn't realize it until it was time to go to bed, and I told Ava that I forgot to give her family this chocolate bar, and that I would give it to her the next time I saw her. I also told her that if my parents ask if I gave her family the bar, I'm going to say that I gave it to Ava and she ate it, and she agreed.

My mom called me the next morning and asked if I gave her family the bar, so I lied that I gave it to Ava and she ate it, figuring that if I hid the bar when I got home and gave it to her the next time I saw her, I could get away with it and Ava got what she wanted, her king-sized chocolate bar.

When my family showed up later to pick me up, Ava told my sister that she had to tell her something. I knew what she was going to say so I told her not to tell my sister but she did anyways. My sister then told my dad who told my mom that I forgot the chocolate bar at home.

It felt like a long car ride home. My mom was mad at me for lying because it wasn't that big of a deal if I'd forgotten it and she could have stopped by Meijer to get something because it was nice of Ava's family to let me spend the night at their house for free and by not giving them something as a thank you, I'm sort of scamming them. She also said that if I told her the truth, I would have only gotten in trouble for forgetting, but since I lied, I'm in trouble for forgetting and lying about it. She said that she can't trust me now because I told her earlier that I studied at Ava's house, I could have been watching kdramas for all she knows, even though I did actually study at their house. My dad chimed in and said that because he told my sister to take my Converse without my permission, he was going to pay me $5 as comp, but since I lied, I don't get $5 anymore. But I wasn't listening all that closely because I was mostly pissed at Ava because she was getting her candy anyways (although later) so she really had no reason to open her mouth. I thought, I gave her my notes, username, and password for this really expensive SAT prep course, and she backstabbed me for no reason? I thought to myself, damn, I really would have gotten away with this if Ava didn't open her mouth.

But am I the asshole for lying? Is this my karma for lying? Should I have told Ava not to tell my whole family instead of just telling her not to tell my parents? Is she not exactly in the wrong for only directly telling my sister who told everyone else?",3,3,3,,,,,
128,"Burner account since some of my friends are Reddit users. 

I (36M) got married to my wife (30F) a few years ago at a Justice of the peace. She’s a foreign national from Montenegro. She was completing her masters here when we met. I’m a US citizen from New York. We were going to travel to her home country later that in the winter for me to meet them. Then Covid happened. Fast forward three years and I finally have the money and time off to travel. Book all of the flights and hotels. Planned it all out to spend five weeks traveling. Start in her country, Montenegro, then Greece, Albania, Croatia and fly back to Montenegro for another few days. Then fly home. All of the stars are aligning. 

A few weeks prior to us traveling she says she wants a break. It’s not that she doesn’t love me, she wants to figure out who she is as a person. She doesn’t want to sleep with anyone. I’ve made life to comfortable for her. She’s had issues finding a job in her field. She wants to figure her shit out. I respond with something along the lines of, “ok i guess. I don’t know if I should meet your parents if we might be divorcing.” I didn’t want to add any emotional baggage to something that was a 50/50 shot of ending. She agreed to that. She asked if she should still go on the trip. I said yes of course. 

Fast forward a few weeks and we’re here. I ask her the morning I’m supposed to meet them if her stance has changed on her needing to figure things out. She said no. I told her it’s probably best I don’t meet her parents then. She was very hurt and offended. She had talked to them saying I was looking forward to finally meeting them, I really was. Now she is going to have to make up an excuse for why I can’t meet them. She was very very hurt. I hadn’t seen her more hurt than that moment. I understand being hurt, but we discussed it before the trip. 

So, am I the asshole in this scenario? I might be and I’ll accept that. Should I have reminded her a few days prior to our agreement. In hindsight, yes. Should I have kept my mouth shut and met them? Probably. I feel terrible because I think I might have put the nail in the coffin with my marriage by not meeting them.

129,"
I pay 1500 dollars for my schools meal plan, and they have this downstairs area that makes breakfast sandwiches on demand. They have this breakfast burrito that I like, but the last 10 times I went there they always forgot to put salsa in. The last 10 times I’d be real friendly, just say “hey can I get in the sandwich,” and then not complain when they didn’t put it in there. It’s a small thing but I’m paying 1500 bucks for this plan, and I feel like if I ask for salsa in it, which is absolutely allowed there’s no rule against it and they do it regularly, is that too much to ask for?

Anyway, today, I was stressed and just wanted my savory salsa-y breakfast burrito. But they’d screwed up the last 10 times, so I really condescendingly said “can I have it in the burrito. Not on the side. Not in the bag. Inside. The. Sandwich.” And one of the workers who always screwed up the order starts telling me that I’m being mad disrespectful (I was, I’m not gonna deny that) and he’s saying “there’s a nicer way to ask that,” and I just told him “the last 10 times I was sweet as honey and look what good that did me.” They mocked me openly behind my back while I filled up my coffee, yeah. But like come on. I was really nice all the other 10 times, and I was stressed. I apologized to them personally, because I understand there was probably a better way to handle that now that I’m seeing things clearly, but come on. I just want salsa in my burrito. I’ve avoided being rude to workers in my life and am usually pretty compassionate, but it was just this time I kinda snapped.
So lay it on me thick. AITA?

130,"Background: my(26F) husband (28M) has one sister (20F) and two sister-in-laws (SIL 1: 32F and SIL 2: 24F). Both sister-in-laws blatantly lied to both of his siblings in order to marry them, don’t know why honestly but that’s a different story for a different day. 

I have kind of been ostracized from them since they had multiple arguments because SIL 2 lies about literally everything and I said I just don’t want to hang out with someone if it’s gonna end up that she’s going to lie about me like she did other 2 SILS. well they all always spend time with each other even though they all hate each other and the past couple of times we’ve had the entire family together and took family pictures they’ve taken pictures alone, excluded me. And I don’t just mean they took photos while I wasn’t in the room. Last month at SIL 1 baby shower after MIL, SILS and I took a photo and I walked away to speak to my fiancé SIL 2 went “okay picture of *her and SILS names*” when I was 5 feet away. It broke my heart because oldest SIL and youngest SIL both despise this other sil and yet did not invite me to take a photo with them.

During this time I’ve been planning a wedding. I was going to have SIL 1 and husbands sister as my bridemaids but they both randomly blocked me due to unrelated family drama they created and  talked about me behind my back to create drama and deflect from themselves so I decided to just have my friends instead. None of them were invited dress shopping, none of them were invited to my bachelorette party out of state and I already was hearing flack about it. 

Flash forward to our wedding. It was last weekend and it was amazing. After the incident at the baby shower I was pissed that I was always the one left out when I wasn’t the one causing any problems. So when we were taking photos I decided to take photos of me with my bridal party, and then with my own sister and sister in laws who I’m not really close to. This obviously got under their skin like I wanted it to because of how often I had been left out of things. I heard an earful from my MIL and FIL about it hearing about the “importance of family” and I just told them “you reap what you sow” and left it at that. My husband fully agrees with what I’ve done and has had several talks with his family prior of how they don’t treat us the same as his other siblings. 

We’re on our honeymoon right now and haven’t stopped hearing complaints. I just want to know AITA?",2,1,2,,,,,
131,"I (23f) recently stayed at my dad (60s) and his long term girlfriends (50s) new home, where my step sister (19f) lives too. It’s really important that I mention here that my dad doesn’t own the house, his girlfriend does, but my dad pays half the bills, is paying for renovations and it’s his registered address. 

I stayed over for a long weekend, and this was my second visit since they moved in over Christmas. I live 70 miles away in my dads old house where we had lived as a two since 2014 with my boyfriend which we bought off him before this move. 

My mum and dad divorced when I was very young, nothing traumatic but this of course still comes with the baggage. I don’t have a particularly close bond with my mum, I consider my dad my main single parent. My dad has been with his girlfriend for upwards of 15 years. 

I generally really like her, we are on very good terms with each other, and beside the odd weird comment we don’t tend to ever have any issues. Likewise, my little sister is great. 

My dad over the years of me growing up spent most weekends at her old house, which I would sometimes go as well and stay in the box room but as I got older this died down. Eventually my boyfriend moved into our house with my dad and my dad would stay at his girlfriends for weeks at a time. 

Back to the present, I had a very lovely trip at the new house this weekend as we had so much fun and I was really enjoying the feeling of being in a family home. 

I took a picture of the house and posted it on my social media on the last night saying I had a great weekend at my dads house. To my surprised, that evening I received a passive aggressive text message from his girlfriend in another room which went along the lines of ‘I’m glad you like my house. This is my house which I’m lucky to own. See you again soon good night’ 

I had a huge panic attack and replied that I was sorry and only captioned it that way as to not upset my mum, and that I loved her house and was grateful to stay there. This is partly a lie, I mainly called it that without thinking as I was just so happy to be with my dad. 

This upset me as I’m already quite insecure about this. I didn’t go on the house viewings with the three of them, I don’t have my own room like my sister and instead sleep in a generic spare bedroom, I barely spend any time there and there’s minimal evidence of me in the house. 

I feel really sad as I felt like I was included over this weekend and that I had somewhere to call a family home, and my caption on social media honestly was written in 10 seconds and I didn’t put any deep thought into it. I know it’s not my dads and I know I’m a guest. I feel really unwelcome at the house now and cried all the way home. 

I’m worried that IATA and it’s ok if I am. I’ve already deleted the post and gone home as planned.

132,"I (29F) and my boyfriend of 2 years (30M) just moved in together last week. We were both living separately until then. Now I know I have been off on annual leave last week, and because of this, I would be doing the brunt of the workload during his working hours, but considering his Dad and I moved almost all of his things - bar really heavy items (i.e. his massive TV and his heavy weights) as I have a bad heart.

I got annoyed at him on Saturday, as I had been busy building furniture for the bathroom, and he fell asleep on the couch and didn't help much around the house at all.

This is where I may be the AH. I snapped at him earlier today and confronted him, saying that whilst I appreciate that he has been busy with work, but I also work full time and I don't think it's fair that I'm doing all of the house work. He bit back saying he sorted everything out into their allocated rooms (because he wanted his training room up and running), but in the end that just gave me even more work to do in order to have a liveable space. He also argued that he set up the bills, which I'll concede there.

133,"I (17f) live with my mom (50F). Since I remember myself I’ve been under a lot of stress from my mom when it comes to school. My mom is constantly pressuring me to study non-stop by calling me names and telling me I’d end up in the streets. I don’t even have many friends due to that reason because I never have time for them. 

Today I went to a party with my friend group and during that party, my biology teacher sent a text to each student about an extra private lesson for Tommorow before an important exam. My phone was on silent so I had no idea until I turned my phone back on and saw the lesson had already been taken by another student. 

I came back home to see my mom sitting and waiting for me. She was convinced i read the message on time and asked me how am I going to wake up in time for my lesson.I told her I’m not going because another student already took the extra hour. She got furious and screamed at me that I’m an “Idiotic b” so I snapped back and shouted “you’re the one who’s a b” (ik it sounds ridiculous but in my language it’s a very harsh word). which made her go completely silent.

134,"I never leave poop behind if I can help it. There’s been times I’ve had to leave it till the next walk because my husband used the last bag and didn’t swap the roll but I’ll come back and pick it up every time. I don’t want to be the person that leaves it behind ti be stepped in because I would hope others would do the same. Of course you can’t always get it all like I couldn’t today but you do your best.
So my good boy today I’m guessing had a sore stomach since he was panting and acted like he wanted out so I took him for a walk. Not even 2 minutes in and he was Hershey squirting. It was a lot and it was gross. Kinda like watery porridge consistency. I picked up what I could, needed two bags but of course couldn’t get all the grass cleaned off. Jackson and I kept walking and went around the corner of the building we were in front of. Now let me tell you this is Jackson’s poop spot. He poops there everyday so these people have for sure seen me before and if they haven’t that’s crazy because he’s been pooping there since I got him about 6 maybe 7 months ago so you would think they’ve seen me pick it up before. 
Anyway, he squatted again but this time really nothing came out but some liquid and the smallest amount of fecal matter. Now when I say a small amount I mean like the size of a quarter or smaller. If I tried to pick it up I would have needed to dig it out to get it or use a bag and smush it in when I’m trying not to and waste a bag. When my poor boy was done dripping I turned to walk and a person banged on their window at me. I couldn’t see from where since there was a glare but this is a three story building. I think it was the second story since the window appeared to be shaking and no others were.
I gestured to the fact that there was nothing there while saying so as though they could hear me and pointed at my two bags and said that I would pick it up if there were something there to pick up and that I was sorry but I wasn’t wasting a bag to pretend to pick something up and then kept walking.
Part of me feels offended since I am always sure to pick up my big boy’s poop and that the time I had nothing to pick up I was being watched. The other part of me says that I should have wasted the bag on it. I asked my hubby what he thought and he said people suck but I still have part of me that’s on window banger’s side.

So am I the ass hole?
For anyone who may ask, Jackson is half Great Dane and half Labradoodle so a big dog at 9 months hence two bags. Yes I will try to post a dog tax photo in the comments. I’m writing from my phone so I apologize for the format.

Thanks for reading. Hope you have a great day!!!",1,1,,2,,,,

I (18F) am married to my husband (19m). We got married young because we had a baby when we were 17&amp;18 and share a 1 year old son. When we found out I was pregnant, his family was so excited. They set up a baby shower for us during COVID even though nobody could go, just to make me feel special. 

A important part of the story is that my in laws do not speak great english, if any at all. There is very little communication between us, or it is translated between my husband. 

Other than that, my husband has a dog that currently lives at his parents. The dog was a family idea, but once my husband bought it, everyone decided they didnt want to help. He is called all hours of the night to let the dog go potty, even though they are 4 feet away from the dog and we do not live there. This was the starting point. After this he started running errands for them while he was visiting the house, including picking up McDonalds which he was asked to pay for. At this point I was mad and told him he was being used. He disagreed and said I was being disrespectful to his parents. 

I let it go for a while, but recently its just getting worse. He was sick and definitely needed to rest so he asked his parents to take the dog out. They were furious and cussed him out over the phone. He hung up and went to bed because he was so tired. I waited till he fell asleep and turned off his ringer so he could get some rest.

He woke up the next day with 20+ texts and missed calls from his parents telling him how horrible he is and irresponsible. He felt awful he slept through the messages and I told him to be glad he got to rest and not worry about it. 

This snowballed into them picking fights with him randomly and even complaining to his boss about him. That was the last straw for me. He was so upset and both of his parents were telling him how disrespectful he is to them. 

I bottle up how I feel because I know he is close with his mom, but I cant anymore. It is beyond what I thought it could be. My husband has been financially responsible for himself since he was 12. They dont help him in any way. 

I finally told him how I felt and that I was tired of being a babysitter for ignorant and rude people. I expressed that he is depressed and exhausted from this relationship and it needs to end. He got so mad that I would suggest that and told me I was being so disrespectful and its none of my business. I don’t think I am the asshole for suggesting it because clearly this relationship is toxic to us, but my husband will not cut them off no matter what they do. 

He is their grocery shopper, babysitter, chauffeur, he even pays some of their bills. They are extremely selfish, and I do not want to be around them anymore. 

Am I the asshole?",2,2,,3,,,,

I (40f) work in the sales and manufacturing field and we have certain metrics we have to attain. My supervisor(43m) likes to send out stats about our performance to everyone in the office. Every job prior I had does the same thing, and they would send these detailed reprorts on stats with employee numbers to make it more anonymous. However, my current bosses decided to send it with our ALL our information to everyone.  

I found this personally uncomfortable because I don’t like people to know what my metrics are. To me my information is for me to see only between my supervisors and myself and if I wanted other coworkers, it would be my choice to share this or not. 

I emailed this concern because they had a “open door policy” and we can write to them with any concern we had about performance, company concerns, etc. I asked them to not show our actual names but instead show our employee ID (which is harder to tell who’s who) so that way it’s more discreet. My reasoning is because there has been countless times and currently as well, where others who are doing better than other coworkers make fun of them jokingly or not and call them bottom feeders and they don’t want to be on certain jobs with them. There has even been countless times when HR was even involved as well. Also this become a constant competition at work and people end up talking shit about each other. 

My supervisor emailed a response saying that “thanks for the information, we believe in sharing information will make our office a stronger and cohesive team. We  believe its “our” information to share. There was no intent to embarrass anyone. We this as “info and team sharing” to recognize performances and opportunities to improve.” To me, this sounded like “hahaha. Too bad so sad. We don’t give a damn in what you said.” When all I asked was to switch the names to employee IDs instead. 

I just wanted to know if AITA for not wanting to show my metrics to other coworkers?",2,1,,1,,,,
137,"So I was at a dance on friday (3 days ago). It was a school dance, and my friends and I having fun and whatever, sitting against a wall. We were eating pizza and joking around about a few pictures we took, when suddenly a group of other students crowds in front of us (forming kinda like a circle). And we were like, ""what are they doing here?"" so one of my friends (i'll call her Soda) walks up to them with me just curious as to what was happening. Some of my other friends were in on it, following around the crowd of about 10(?) people. So I try to figure out why they're over by our spot, being curious and all. 

I ask one of my friends that are in it what was going on and apparently one of my friends (the one in the center of the circle that was formed), we'll call her Ellie, brought her boyfriend in from another school and was now trying to sneak him out. There was an argument I couldn't catch and still don't understand why they were, so I thought I'd stay close to them since the crowd seemed fine with my other friends being near. But then suddenly one of the girls in the group tells us to leave in a very bitchy way. So Soda snaps back and tells her that we were here first, and the girl responds with ""yeah, over THERE,"" pointing to the wall we were at. She shoos us and Soda shouts at her something I can't say. 

A few minutes later Ellie and her boyfriend, the ones escaping, so as instinct I look at them leave and the girl being rude (i'm going to call her Jess) yells at us to not look because we are drawing attention to her. I thought that would've been a good explanation if there wasn't just a whole bunch of people staring down the hallway Ellie were escaping through. Even one of my friends yelled at me for looking in their direction. 

Personally I'm not so sure if they were being reasonable but I'm not sure. Let me know if I was (or not, you don't have to)!",None,1,,1,,,,

I (21F) have been dating my BF(22m) for about 4 months now.  We are both in college and I absolutely love him and we get along great however we’ve recently had our first argument. We once went out to an all you can eat sushi restaurant and ever since than I’ve been talking about how I’ve been wanting to go again. 

About two weeks ago he went out with a group of his friends. I wasn’t upset at all, but I did mention that I missed that place and would like to go again soon before he goes back home after graduation. This week he went again with his friends and even told me he was going. It feels wrong for me to ask to go with him because I feel as though I am just inviting myself, but I did mention I was jealous. 

I’ve been asking some of my other friends to go with me but all of them are busy and he knows this. I have also invited him to go with me a couple times before but he declined as well. 

The next time I saw him I briefly mentioned he owes me sushi because of this and that made him slightly upset. Saying that I can always go by myself. 

I have no idea why he doesn’t want to take me to the sushi place, he has no issues taking me out to other places. 

I explained to him that I’m hurt that because I have mentioned multiple time how much I like that place and wanted to go again. He said he just wanted to hang out with his friends and that he doesn’t always have to bring me everywhere. 

AITA for wanting to get sushi with him?",1,2,,1,,,,
139,"Sorry about any formatting issues. I’m on mobile. For context I work at the food court in a big retail store. I’m a barista on weekends, and I make pizzas and wings on weekdays. We had five people scheduled in the front, and everyone who was scheduled to be in by then except the opener O (F25) had called out. When I came in the closer G (F21) wasn’t planning on calling out. The fourth person in ended up calling out as well, so I texted G. I told her we had call outs and that my plan was for her and O to man the front while I’d keep cafe open and take care of their stuff in the back. I also called to ask if she could come in early. She said no. She then told me she was going to call out. We had to call in C (M27) in on his day off to cover her shift and we closed 4 hours early. Looking back I probably shouldn’t have said anything. I just wanted her to know what to expect, and why I was asking if she could come in early. She apologized to O, but was later talking crap about her with another coworker, and we’ve seen each other once since then but she didn’t say anything. Yesterday T (M21) and I were scheduled in the back, but G and another person called out. I had to step in again since both our morning support and pre closer had called out, and we had to close both the back and the front early. I’d give her the benefit of the doubt for yesterday, but she later posted a photo of her going out with some friends during what would’ve been her shift. I don’t normally get upset over these things. Everyone has their reasons I understand, and sometimes you just need to take one for the team. Deliberately leaving us stranded and forcing us to call someone in on their day off just because she doesn’t want to deal with it, and then only saying something to one person.

141,"Last year my Dad, 52M, eloped to Gretna Green to marry the woman he's been seeing for the year prior. 

I was, in loose terms, emotionally and financially abused when living with him and his previous wife of 10 years. So when he got a divorce and apologized and made up to me, I was overjoyed to have my good old Dad back and we made up for lost time. It wasn't long before he met another woman, who I never really met properly after I moved back home with my Mother, whom he was separated from since 2008. 

After a year of seeing his latest partner, they married. The relationship with my Dad was turbulent to say the least and I have never forgiven him fully for the abuse he allowed and contributed to in my childhood, so I didn't have a lot of contact with him - We spoke maybe once a month.

One day in June 2022, without warning, a video was sent into a group chat and on Facebook of his wedding. They had not invited anyone and, allegedly, told no one. There were no lock-down restrictions in place for context.

After seeing this a lot of past trauma was brought up for me and I waited for weeks to see if my dad would contact me. When he eventually did, he basically said it shouldn't matter to me that there was no warning or invite because he was happy, and he wouldn't be this upset if he wasn't invited or told about my wedding (his eldest daughter of 3 - the only one he has kept contact with).

My question is - Am I The Asshole for being so mad that I have cut contact from my Dad for marrying and not telling me in order to surround myself with family who understand my emotional support needs.",1,2,,2,,,,
142,"BTW sorry if this is hard to read, it's my first post.

So I (16F) and my friend ""Olivia"" (16F) were walking together to our next class. It was silent, so I decided to start a conversation. I said in an upbeat tone ""Hey, we've been quite distant recently. We should talk more."" This was true: we were both busy with school and other things. In hindsight this was a weird way to start a convo. Her reaction was scoffing and telling me ""I'm BUSY. And I talk to you just as much as everyone else in our friend group!"" This was kinda weird, it seemed really defensive and out of nowhere, rubbed me the wrong way yk? I think she said this because in the past I've spoken to her about feeling left out of our group, so she may have thought I was accusing her. I asked her ""Why are you getting pissed at me?"" because I was honestly really confused. We had a little back-and-forth and then I sped off to class, where we didn't talk much.

Later, I saw her again and asked why she was so annoyed at what I said (context: I'm quite blunt with my words as I'm autistic and always ask straight up what I did to upset people to understand better) and she started being overly defensive. She said things like ""Why bring it up so randomly?"", ""I feel like you're accusing me."" and ""That was a pointless thing to say!"". What topped it was hen I told her I don't always know how to start conversations and she said that I CHOSE to start it wrong. I got fed up and sped off to avoid blowing up at her.

At lunch, I sat with everyone and she was acting normal. For more context, there had been some drama in the friend group earlier that day, and she and several others had been getting up to talk about it away from the friend group. I wanted to avoid causing a scene so I decided to nonchalantly ask, ""Hey, Olivia, can we talk really quickly?"". I thought she would say yes as there was no point to keep it waiting. I thought wrong. She snapped at me and said, ""There's nothing to talk about! We don't need to talk! I want to spend time with my friends!"". I was really confused so I asked her again calmly if we could step aside for a second and she said that we can just text about it later. I'll admit I got quite upset, because she had stepped away to talk with our other friends but not with me about something that was clearly bothering both of us, so I left to cool off. I thought she would then text me after school ended as she said we could, but I didn't want to text her first because she offered to do so. She never followed up.

This has been upsetting to me. I KNOW that when we see eachother, she will act as if nothing happened, so I'm not going to speak to her until she takes the first step. In our past arguments, I have ALWAYS had to reach out first to clear things up, and I'm sick of it. Whenever I would bring up my feelings she would dismiss me and make me feel lesser than her, but I've had enough and don't want to speak to her unless she finally chooses to clear things up.",1,2,,2,,,,
143,"Today I had the day off, and my wife and I planned to go clothes shopping for our daughter (2mo). My wife had a morning appointment, so the plan was for me &amp; my daughter to take the train to meet her and then we'd go shopping.

The start of my journey is all going well until my baby starts some intense crying. I'm standing outside the station by my house, trying a few different things to settle her and getting increasingly exasperated, and I text my wife this. She replies she'll meet me at a different station halfway to the store. I don't know exactly when her appointment will be over, but I'm concerned about how long this baby-settling is taking, so I text my wife back to say she might need to wait for us. My exact words are ""might be waiting a while"".

Ten minutes later, I have settled the baby and got onto a train, and I look at my phone again. There are seven texts from my wife, getting mad at me for being vague, asking what's going on, and then saying she's leaving to go home.

I text her back saying to meet us at the station as planned, and she refuses. She is super angry, saying that ""might be waiting a while"" is vague, and means that the plan is off, so she came to help me (this doesn't make sense to me because she went home, but last I told her I was at the station). She keeps calling me and yelling, which is disturbing my daughter who is napping, so I hang up and text her. We argue while I travel on the train to our original meeting point, with me saying let's continue with the plan, and her refusing and saying I've screwed her over and I should come back.

I arrive at the meeting point (15 mins have elapsed since I asked her to wait). She calls me again and is yelling asking why don't I understand what I've done wrong. She says she couldn't just wait an unspecified amount of time for me, that I have broken her heart because she was looking forward to this and I have ruined it. I say we can wait here for her, or she can catch us up, and I apologize for being vague. She still refuses, saying it's too late (she's maybe 20 mins behind us now).

I'm halfway to the store and this is the only day I have to do this, so I continue on, still urging my wife to catch up with us. She's saying I am taking this from her and should have turned around. Eventually I get to the store, buy some things, have a nice time with my daughter and we head home.

My wife is obviously fuming, and has still not given up on this ""you think you did nothing wrong!"". I apologize again, although honestly I do not think I did anything wrong. It wasn't a detailed text, but I was wrangling a screaming baby, and was available to explain further just 10 mins later. Abandoning the plan based on that text seems like an unjustified reaction to me, and it was this and her own stubbornness that caused her to miss the shopping trip. I do not understand her position at all. AITA?",1,2,,1,,,,
144,"For my mother's birthday we decided to go to a fancy and rather expensive restaurant. I offered to pay for her part of it as her birthday present. I don't currently have a job as I have long Covid (had to give up my career and move back to my home country because of it), but I have an extremely small weekly income and some saved money. The dinner is something I have budgeted for, not easy, but doable.   
When I booked the table I booked for 4 people to allow her to invite friends (the friends paying for themselves), although the friends she originally planned to invite were unavailable. She later decided to invite wealthy relatives of ours instead. These relatives have a lot of money and like to play host. My mother goes out with them quite often, and after a point I know they started to have tussles over who would pay the bill. My mother earns very good money and is proud, but doesn't have anything like their wealth. 

Now my mother is saying that I need to make sure that these relatives only pay for themselves for this dinner, otherwise my ""gift"" to her isn't really a gift. I fully expected to make sure I pay for her as I said I would, and I have already paid for a $165 bottle of champagne to be open on the table for everyone when we arrive. 

I really don't see why I can't let them pay for my share if they insist. I feel like this is about her pride, and currently I don't have much pride when it comes to money after being so sick for 3+ years. They are my relatives too, and I don't have her resources.

So i woke up from the spam calls and pings, so i went on dnd after talking to her a little bit and getting annoyed by how needy and spammy she was. So i went back to sleep. Then when i wake up i tell my gf good morning, then she says goodmorning back and thats all we said until night cus i was busy with family stuff. 

Later that night around she tells me “go to your room” so we can call, we then hop on call and she instantly asks “why are you on dnd” and i tell her why, and a screenshot of the girl who was annoying me. It all escalated from here. 

She says “why didn’t you tell me sooner” and then i respond with “theres no reason to tell you about someone who just annoyed me at 5 in the morning” it begins to escalate some more to the point im getting genuinely annoyed. 

So i then say “dont talk to me until you stop accusing me of things i havent done”
She still kept talking and said something like “you kept it from me until i asked” and i respond with “i didnt keep anything from you, you asked why i was on dnd, i showed you why and now you think I’m lying to you and hiding something. Theres no reason to tell you about it”

 it escalated alot more from here so i tell her what she is saying is stupid and irrational.
And then she says “stupid and irrational is insane. You know how odd it is for u to be texting a girl while on call w me and I’m sleeping and then when I’m upset about it it’s stupid and irrational” i then tell her all i did was reply to someone in my dms. 

Then she said “Shoulda put that bitch down when you realized it wasn’t me” she then wanted me to apologize. And i told her “i can block you if you keep trying to put me in the wrong for something thats not even bad” 

she then asks me to apologize once more and i refuse to because im not going to apologize for something i havent done. Then she said “You got ur little dunce hat on. Because you have to be fucking stupid to not realize you are wrong in this situation and I don’t know what’s going on in ur fucking head to make u think I’m about to apologize or something but you really have life fucked up” (i never asked her to apologize once in this situation).

147,"I, 17(f), have a 13(f) sister Nat

Natalie has been collecting plants for a really long time. She has rare ones that she's proud of, and they're really pretty.

I have this one friend named Alex 18(f), who also is into plants but doesn't have much of a collection.\\

Three months ago, she got a plant called a ""Pink Princess."" If anyone doesn't know what that is, it's a green-leaved plant with a few light pink leaves. She liked it and treated it like a baby, lol.

Alex freaked when she first saw it; she said that was her dream plant. She'd ask Nat about it and take pictures to send to her mom. She asked if she could have some cuttings to propagate, but Nat said no.

She kept begging, and my sister got mad at her. She stopped letting Alex take pictures, and Alex stopped talking to her.

One day, I had Alex over, and I was taking a nap while Nat was at GetAir with her bf.

Alex woke me up at some point and said her mom was here to pick her up,  I said okay, and she left.

I went back to sleep and got woken up again by Nat screaming and crying in my face. She asked if I stole any of her leaves to give to Alex, and I told her no. She showed me her plant, and it did look like a few leaves were missing, but it wasn't too noticeable. I did call Alex about it, though, and she admitted it on the phone. She said she mainly only stole 'baby leaves' and would repay my sister for the amount she took.

I hung up and was angry that Alex snuck behind my back to do that, and my mom came home, and my mom banned Alexis from ever coming back to my house. I blocked her, too, when she tried to Apple pay me.

It was silent for months before yesterday in Econ class; she came up to me crying and basically just saying how sorry she was and how she's been trying to apologize but couldn't because I blocked her. She told me how hard things were at home and how much she needed me.

I could tell she was actually sorry, so I hugged her and said I'd give her another chance if she promised to not do that again. She agreed.

I texted Nat that Alex and I made up, and Nat left me on read. I came home, and my mom and Nat were on the couch. I brought up the Alex thing to my mom and asked my mom if Alex would ever be able to come over this weekend if she apologized to Natalie and Nat burst into tears and said she hated me.

I explained to Nat I understood why she's pissed but that Alex doesn't have the best situation, and it really would help for her to be out of the house, and Nat begged my mom to never let her in our house again.

My mom was mad I would even ask her, and she said it was awful I was friends with a ""dirty thief."" I argued it was only friends with her after she apologized, but my mom said I was being a bad sister by forgiving her.

I can only hang out with Alex when I'm at our dad's house now because Nat refuses to go over there.

I still understand why they're mad, but I feel like they don't get that Alex has reasons for why she is the way she is and that she's sorry.

148,"There's a lot to unpack here. Theres me,28f, my bf, 30m, and our baby, 1f. We got pregnant early early in our relationship. Before we knew I was pregnant, we had big fight cause he wanted some girl from work to give him a ride home, and I had asked to meet her whenever she picked him up. He fought me for two weeks on this,that I should just ""trust"" him. He knew my last relationship ended because I found my then bfs dating profile on tinder, but things settled with me being pegged the psycho girlfriend because I stood my ground that I wanted to meet anyone who was picking up my boyfriend at my apartment, it seemed like a reasonable thing to ask. For a year now, anytime the argument is referenced he passes it off as me being territorial. 

So there's the background, here's the now.
He started working at this new place, and is getting rides from a guy 30m, who tech just hasn't gotten his surgery yet, you know? So, still female but identifies as a guy and all that. I totally respect that, it doesn't bother me. 

The problem is that my boyfriend got drunk the other day, and started asking if it would still be considered cheating because of his coworker identifying as a man, despite being currently female,physically. 

Me,personally, yes. Im monogomous. ANYONE WHO ISNT ME,WOULD BE CONSIDERED CHEATING. The only difference I've ever distinguished, Is that I don't have male parts, and his best friend does. Ergo, a running joke that  I'm now regretting having started.

He says I'm just being crazy and territorial.

I found some Figs scrubs (the nice brand) for a pretty good price, and I asked the seller if they would be able to ship the scrubs and have them here in 3 days. I apologized for the inconvenience! 

She asked for my zip code, and told me she would let me know how much the total price would be. 

The next day, I get a message from her saying she had shipped the scrubs, but had to do it next day, which cost $36. I was taken aback, because I hadn’t paid her for the other scrubs yet, and had I known it cost that much to do that for those, I wouldn’t want to continue with the purchase. But she had already shipped them. So I paid her, but I don’t feel comfortable paying that much.

He will get married soon and has recently become a Protestant, like his future wife. They attend many religious events together and sing / play Christian songs and Christian music with other people from Church.

He has asked me if I would agree to play the drums on religious songs during his wedding with other people from Church. 

I understand some people need religions, that they can have a positive effect on them, I respect that, but I am an Atheist and not having a religion is important to me. 

So I didn't accept to play the drums with this religious band, that would require me to work on 4-5 songs which music I don't like with lyrics I don't agree with. I wouldn't feel at ease.

He's not mad at me but he insists, so I was wondering what you guys think.

AITA?",,,,,2,2,2,2
151,"My sister and I are a year apart in age. She's 27 and I'm 26. Growing up we weren't exactly close but we were okay. We have a cousin Beth who is 27. My sister always saw her as a potential BFF and always wanted to hang out with her, but she was way too intense for Beth and was kinda stalkery around Beth. For example she requested a change in class schedule every year of high school a week in so they'd be in all the same classes, she wanted to join every extra curricular Beth did, if Beth was over at our house she'd make up a reason for our parents to let her walk Beth home, even when Beth didn't want to walk with her, she'd wait for her at her locker in school just to speak to her, she asked our parents to take her to a soft play area when she was younger because Beth was going to a party there. Stuff like that was constant. To make things worse Beth and I got along really well. My sister used to hate it and would insert herself into everything and attempt to push me out. More recently she invited Beth to be there when she had my nephew.

Now my sister and I have babies 4 days apart in age. My sister and I chose names that are very different stylistically for our kids. She went with George for her son. My daughter is Lyric. I don't do a lot of social media but I do have an Instagram and Beth commented on the post where I announced my daughter's name saying how much she loved it, etc.

Then a few weeks later we were all at our grandparents and Beth brought up my daughter's name and how she thought it fit her perfectly and was cute. My sister was so jealous. When my partner and I were leaving she asked me why the hell Beth liked my daughter's name so much and how come she never gushed about George the same was she did Lyric. She said she assumed that an Elizabeth who went by Beth would appreciate a strong, classic, royal name. I told her it was nothing to do with me. She told me I must have asked Beth what kind of names she liked when I was pregnant and that's why she was so in love with my daughter's name. She told me I always hogged Beth and that my daughter has a dumb name and she'll hate me.

I could feel the jealousy rolling off her even without her saying that. But it made me realize how we need to keep our distance and I don't want my daughter subjected to that. Now my sister is suggesting that we do joint stuff with the kids. So like birthday parties and Easter parties and stuff. I was like no way are we doing that. She was saying it was perfect and I was being selfish and denying the cousins the chance to be close. I told her her jealousy and over the top reactions to it are why we're not doing joint stuff and that she is not going to get the chance to treat my daughter the way she treats me and is not going to ruin my daughter's special celebrations just because she's jealous that I get along with Beth.

My sister said I was being unfair, bullying her and punishing her for feeling left out which ""makes me an even bigger bitch"". AITA?",,,,,1,2,2,1
152,"I (36f) went no contact with my narcissistic family last year as I was done being their scapegoat. 

My friend was encouraging me to ""call my mother and reconcile for mother's day"" and I explained (again) the emotional and mental abuse I went through and her refusal to take accountability or seek therapy. 

She then lectured me on how ""it's hard being a parent"" (she's a parent I'm not) that ""as the eldest you should've helped your mother around the house more and with your younger siblings."" And that ""I should let bygones be bygones and call my mother for mother's day""

I told her ""so you think if I had done more chores and accepted more parentification as a kid then I wouldn't have been abused? If it's too hard to be decent to your kids then you shouldn't be a parent. maybe u should've helped your abusive ex husband around the house more, maybe u shouldn't have had dinner 10 minutes late, bc you know his job is stressful and it's hard being a provider and father. Next.month is father's day you should call and reconcile with him. How could I as a child stop the abusive behavior of an adult when as an adult you couldn't stop your husband from abusing you."" 

She cried and walked off. Our mutual friends agree she was wrong to pressure me to reconcile with my mother but she ""meant well and didn't understand, and you took it too far"" I did it to make a point on how abuse isn't okay from anyone even your parents.

153,"To preface this, my sister (27f) is a POS, she gave me (20F) years of childhood trauma and is genuinely an awful person. She does however have 4 children, all of which I love and care for massively which complicates things. 

Not long ago, I found out my sister was driving around in her boyfriends car - she doesn’t have a driving license and as a result no insurance. She has never had professional lessons, is irresponsible and there has been numerous occasions someone has ‘crashed into’ their car.

We had caught her driving around multiple times alone, she would always deny it. But I reached breaking point when I once spotted her driving around with two of my young nieces in the back. Neither her or her partner have a job and all children live within a 2 minute walking distance to their school. To me, there is no reasonable explanation to put her kids at risk for this.

So I called the non-emergency police line and reported her anonymously. A few days later she was arrested, I don’t know what fines or punishment she has been given as a result.

She has guessed it was me, since I have pulled her up on it before. It’s caused a huge argument in the family where, of course, she wants to stop me seeing my nieces and nephew. 

My mum was upset at finding out she was driving, but it feels like she is angry at me for reporting her and causing all this drama - like she wished that my sister just got caught on her own doing. Was I wrong to report it? Should I have just let it run it’s course? 

TL:DR; I caught my sister driving uninsured and without a license and reported it to the police. She was arrested and now it’s caused a huge argument in the family. Should I have just minded my own business?",,,,,4,1,1,1
154,"My gf and I live together and the tv we currently have is one I bought around 5 years ago before me and my gf were together. The tv is performing badly now and will need replacing soon. I really want an OLED tv so I was looking at prices and reviews and there's one for around £1300 that I have been looking at. I am planning to get it towards the end of the year where I can hopefully get it cheaper in black friday sales.

I told my gf and showed her the tv and she accused me of not prioritising the relationship since that money can be used for a house deposit in the future and I currently only have £2000 in savings. I pointed out we won't be looking for a house for a few years yet anyway and that I am getting a payrise at work next month so when it actually comes to buying the tv my savings will pretty much be double what they are now. She just repeated that my savings should be for things like a house deposit. I tried explaining to her that when the time comes for us to put a deposit down I'd have the money but she just said I shouldn't be getting the tv and that it looks like I'm not taking our future seriously.

155,"
so, about a year and a half ago when the wedding was being planned , i (23F) was supposed to be in the bridal party as a bridesmaid. in late feb I was not able to attend her dress fitting, and after that, I was given no update about my involvement within the wedding despite reaching out to let her know i’m still open and available. 

I had found out about a month and a half after the dress fitting that I was silently removed from the bridal party when i got an email from the bridal party in regards to her bridal shower. I had asked her what happened and if there was any issues or anything that I did to cause this, she said no and that it slipped her mind to tell me. (I had already bought my bridesmaid dress before i was removed and she knew this). 

on top of that, everybody who is invited to this wedding, is either a family member of the bride and groom or a mutual friend, of the bride and groom. I however, am the only friend who does not have a connection to both parties of the wedding. 

I have met her fiancé two times which I didn’t think would be an issue until I realized that I would have nobody to talk to for the entirety of the wedding. 

ultimately that is what is really bothering me. I can’t imagine spending the whole day and $300 for a gift on this whole thing after everything that’s happened. I just don’t know if I’m a horrible person for not wanting to go anymore despite telling her I would be. truly, am I the asshole? How do I go about this? thank u

156,"Context, I show my boyfriend anything he wants to see on my phone, he has my passcodes, passwords, pins and even knows some of my security questions.

Well I found a phone today while cleaning up the house and I decided to plug it in to see if it still worked. It did and I opened it up and went through the photos to see if I could find a cute younger picture of my boyfriend.

Well, he had pictures on there, and none of which I will disclose but just some of him and his ex. Which I wasn't upset about, this phone has probably been out of service for years so I continued scrolling through his memes. 

But he sees me with it and runs to snatch it from me, literally ripping it out of my hands. 

I'm like, what's the big deal? And he starts yelling about how he doesn't want me to look through his phone, and that there were private photos on there. 

I WASNT EVEN LOOKING FOR ANYTHING RISQUE. I just wanted to see some dorky selfies he probably took. But he goes through and deletes like 300+ photos and hands the phone back to me. 

I would've been okay if he just asked me if ""Hey I kinda get embarrassed about this, could I have my phone back?"" But instead he acts super sketchy, raises my anxiety and then blames it because I was jealous?

Like I'm not jealous at all over 3+ year old photos. I just wanted to see your Snapchat dog filter emoji and now you act like you were actively talking to this person.

So long story short, I changed my passcodes for everything. Privacy is a two way street in my opinion, and I feel like he overreacted. But am I the asshole??",,,,,2,2,1,3

158,"My brother purchased my aunt and uncle's condo from our overseas cousin after they both passed away. My cousin cleared out almost everything except for a few items, including his high school memorabilia, videotapes, my uncle's paintings, and a few other things that my brother was supposed to send to him. Instead, time slipped by without any action on my brother's part.

About eight years later, I found my uncle's beautiful paintings carelessly placed by a puddle in our parents' garage. It turns out that my brother had left them there while they were out of the country. I expressed my concerns to my parents, who didn't know what to do with the paintings. I decided to take one and leave the rest.

When my parents visited my apartment and saw the painting, they had mixed reactions. My mom moved the remaining paintings inside their house to avoid further damage. Later, when my cousin visited for my dad's funeral, he mentioned that he didn't really want the paintings, but there was one in particular that he desired—a portrait of his late brother.

Frustrated by the negligence of the paintings for an entire decade, I took the three remaining landscape paintings and left the portrait for my cousin. I didn't discuss it with anyone since my cousin didn't care about the rest, and my brother had already shown his disregard by dumping them in the garage.

I displayed the four paintings in my apartment, and they looked fantastic. However, when my brother purchased a house in addition to his condo, he suddenly expressed interest in one of the paintings. He texted me, asking if I had taken them, and I confirmed that I had. When he requested one, I reminded him of the years of neglect, and he tried to argue, but I didn't respond.

The next time we met at my mom's house, my brother confronted me about the paintings, and I stood my ground, telling him he had his chance. He lost his temper, yelling insults and threatening to take something important from me. I left, feeling frustrated.

Later, my mom called and blamed me for the situation, saying I should have told her about taking the paintings from her house. She didn't consider them hers, and my brother never asked for permission when he left them there. Now, after his hostile reaction and threats, I refuse to give him a painting. 

Am I the asshole for refusing to give him even one painting despite his years of neglect and no desire to have them for over a decade?",,,,,2,2,3,4

Too make a long story short my son was a teen dad. His girlfriend at the time got pregnant right after they graduated high school and I practically raised their baby girl up until they both graduated college and got jobs. During this time I had my full focus on my grandchild which caused me to very stupidly not pay enough attention to my daughter. We’ve made up since and I’ve been making up for lost time with her. 

The issue is I’m paying for her wedding but I never paid anything for my sons. I felt like I’d already done and spent more than enough for their family that there was no reason for me to. I got them a good gift and a chunk of change and deemed it enough. He’s been causing issues with me and his sister about this and has been slandering us on facebook saying it’s unfair how I’m paying for her wedding but not his. 

I understand feeling a bit bitter but I’ve spent way more money keeping his family and him afloat than I have on my daughters wedding. Honestly paying for her wedding doesn’t even seem enough for what I did. I don’t know how to feel right now and I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could give me feedback on this.",,,,,1,1,1,1
160,"Throwaway for privacy, english is not my first language so sorry for the errors 
I (M24) am married with Tina (26F) and we are expecting a baby, she is 11 weeks. Unfortunately, pregnancy is very hard for her, I try my best to support her the best I can, but to be honest our marriage isn't at its best at the moment, we had several arguments since the pregnancy. 


She works at home and feels a bit lonely sowants me to stay with her as often as possible. So since the beginning of the pregnancy, I just go to work and stay at home with her. She doesn't feel comfortable going out because of the baby weight. It is not a perfect situation but I understand. 


&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I like to have a glass of wine at dinner or a beer in front of the game but Tina has asked me to stop because the smell of alcohol makes her nauseous, no problem. 
Yesterday, in the afternoon my friend Matt called me if I could help him because he has a problem with his water supply (I am quite handy with housework, my father is a plumber so I help my friends sometimes). I asked Tina if I could go, she wasn't very hot but I insisted and told her it won't take long, and accepted. 

&amp;#x200B;


I went to Matt's and we managed to fix the issue, he offered me a beer and I accepted, we sat and talked a little because it was quite long time we didn't hang out together, it was a good moment. Before coming back I took a chewing gum to not smell beer too much. 

&amp;#x200B;


I came home and when I kissed Tina, she smelled the beer and blowed up, she said I was a huge cunt, for abandoning her and the baby to get drunk with my friend and that I was very inconsiderate with her nausea problems. I answered that I only took one beer and I was just gone for 2 hours, I told her that she is controling. She was very angry, she said I was a shit husband and if I don't change I will be a shit father. I chose to going out and have a little breath because I was really shaken up. 
She has been giving me the silence treatment since and I slept on the couch. I also received angry texts by MIL and SIL, they say I am asshole for not supporting Tina. I feel bad because I really try to do my best for Tina and our baby but I'm struggling too, and I honestly don't think sharing a beer with Matt was being incosiderate.

161,"I (26M) have been helping my ex-MIL (47F) with rent for months now. This started back before me and my ex’s relationship ended, but continued afterwards due to ex-MIL having no income and high rent. 

Ex-MIL has had no job for 1.5 years, although she is very much capable. She was a high school teacher and has a master’s degree in business. She is too entitled for her own good and I’ve had it. She also has to support her son (22M) who has a part-time job and goes to school. 

Recently, my ex (27F) has moved away with her new partner and left without helping her family, which I very much understand, but ex-MIL now feels entitled for me to continue helping her as if nothing has changed. I’ve had a serious conversation with her letting her know all income from me will stop, and she is trying to guilt trip me into helping her. She has also tried to make up false accusations about various things to pretend she has dirt on me in order for me to help her. 

I was more than kind enough to give her a few hundred dollars in order to find a new living arrangement, but her, her son and her dog will now have to live in extended stay hotels until she gets a job, or her son saves up enough with the income he gets, which isn’t a lot.

We started talking a lot this past month and are dating now. His trip is coming up soon and I asked him who he was going with and he says “one of my ex’s”. Then he starts saying how he’s going to tell her about us because she always wants to know who he’s dating and he’s never told her before about anyone but he wants to tell her about me. He also said he’s going to call me a lot when he’s on the trip.

He makes me feel very secure in the relationship and I never doubt his feelings or intentions towards me. However, before we started dating, I’ve seen him flirt with everyone around us and I also know he’s a very charismatic person. In my heart of hearts, I don’t think anything will happen between them but I can’t help but feel a little bothered. 

I think it’s unfair of me to bring it up because this trip was planned before anything between us happened. But I also find it weird that he’s so close to his ex that they would be planning a trip together. I also don’t want to say anything before he goes because I don’t want to mess with his trip.

However, lately it's like everything she does is bothersome. (Constantly interrupting me, asking me about very personal topics in public and not even trying to be quiet, and stuff like that.) I was planning on talking to her about it, but then she did something REALLY shitty (we had agreed to be partners for an assignment, and I found out through Instagram that she did it without me and didnt even say anything) She 'apologized' (claimed she thought she had told me, yet also saying she felt bad when she made the decision) and I decided to act civil since we had several classes together and it was so close to the end of the semester

Last weekend I stayed at my grandparents (dad's side) and came back home this morning. Tomorrow I'm going back to my uni and I have to leave at 6 AM. So today I had planned to pack my things, wash my hair (it takes up to 2 hours so it's basically an appointment), change the water of my fish tank, briefly meet my boyfriend and relax.

Just 2 hours prior her supposed arrival, my mother announced my cousin (26F) staying here up until tomorrow morning. 

The exact same thing happened less than 2 weeks ago, that time with the husband of another cousin of my mother, with whom I rarely talk to.
On that occasion, I sucked it up.

Today I'm really pissed off. I told my mother that it would be nice not having people showing up last minute and, had I known it, I would've stayed at my grandparents. We were both angry at this point and she answered that it's a pleasure for her, so I said that's the case JUST for her and she doesn't live alone.

Today I was playing outside with my young daughter and she found a bright green bag and picked it up. It wasn’t till I got closer that I realized that she was squeezing a poop bag. I was mad and annoyed that one of my neighbors would be that disrespectful to bag up their dog poop and leave it out. I went to my security camera to see who created the problem. I was able to get a shot of the person and the dog. Upon seeing the person I realized it matched the same description from another neighbor that posted that morning about the same incident happening in front of their house. I chose to post the photo of the kid to our private HOA group since the previous post with only a description did not gain any traction. 
Later that evening I was greeted by my direct neighbor who I have been great with. He informed me that he was friends. With the kids parents and he thought I was out of line posting a photo of a minor. He asked me how I’d feel if someone posted that same photo of one of my children when they were bigger. I told him I’d walk my child to that house have them knock on the door and apologize. My neighbor was adamant that I crossed a line by posting a photo of a minor. While I may not understand the neighbors frustration I did offer to take the photo down and ask that he talk to the family as I have no clue who or where the kid lives in the neighborhood. 

AITA for posting the photo of the kid leaving dog shit in my yard? 

Other points of consideration I’m the type of guy who would normally have a face to face conversation, But I don’t know where the kid lives or who his parents were. This happened at least twice this weekend as another neighbor posted a similar incident.

I don’t even know when it started and frankly don’t want to recall. She all of a sudden started liking BTS and was so happy to tell me about it since I used to like BTS (in 4th grade for like 2 months). But things got worse. Like real bad. 

She has an “office” room/bedroom in our house that is maxxed out in BTS merch. She has 22 pillows (yes, I counted) of various Korean boys like the actor Lee Minho and of course her favorite BTS member V. I get if it was just something she was so passionate about, but it’s gotten out of hand and I’ve slowly been getting more and more annoyed about it. Like it’s chipping away at me. Her personality has now been centered around BTS. Blankets, accessories, and various other items are scattered all over our house. She’s always ALWAYS listening to them super loudly and whenever I have a bad day at school and just want her to play the music a little quieter, she makes a HUGE scene. She has gone out of her way to text my friends without my knowledge just because she thought they mentioned they liked BTS to see if she could borrow something BTS from them. 

She guilt tripped my dad into buying her a four-thousand-dollar ticket to their concert and still complained that she didn’t get sound check. 

This also has been going on for almost 3 years now. 3 years and I can’t go like 4 hours without hearing her say something about BTS. She even goes out of her way to send me articles and stuff when she knows how much it infuriates me. Important to note that I haven’t always been this angry about it, but her only talking and caring about BTS for around 3 years now the “oh haha my mom is a kpop stan” has turned into pure annoyance. 

Even in my most critical moments when I asked her to just stop talking about it in front of me she got mad. It’s been really hard recently in my life with school and my parents getting divorced (BTS also played a small factor in that but a factor nonetheless) so I did blow up on her today after I was having an awful day at school and she sent me an article. I also had to put up with her basically forcing my friend to talk about them yesterday in the car.

I got a call back from someone who actually sounds like they're from my country (local accent) following up asking for ""Isaac"" - I'll be honest I answered ""No, its Fuck You - stop calling me"" and then the guy got all irate for me being irate and wasting their time.

I know this is a really trivial argument, but I really want to be the only person using my bathroom. I have always had to share a bathroom with others and being able to have a bathroom that is my own was liberating for me. I’ve been asking him to please limit using my bathroom to when he’s working (he works from home and sometimes needs to get back to his computer quickly) but he won’t stop using it. A few weeks earlier, he got really sick and I had to essentially beg him to stop using it because he’s contagious. He even used the shower to take a bath while very courageous because “the temperature works better.” He also left water all over the floor near the shower and the curtains still hanging out the wrong side. 

Last night, when I woke up in the middle of the night feeling sick, he was in there using my bathroom so I went downstairs to use his, only for him to come down and say he needs to use his shower. Why didn’t he just use his own bathroom in the first place?!

170,"I have a twin sister. We are both 22. Our parents are divorced and don't get along, but all four of us were present at the time and those three actually were on the same page for this. Anyway, my sister and I were born and raised in Dallas, but she moved to Austin for college, and I stayed here for college. Well, we just graduated, but she is still staying in Austin to take a gap year. She is also moving out of the dorms into an apartment. 

Well, my dad is a complete pushover, so not only is he paying for her rent, but he is constantly going down from Dallas to Austin to set up her apartment; hauling furniture up there (it is on the second story and there is no elevator), mounting the TV, assembling desks, etc. To add insult to injury, my sister has barely helped, much preferring to grab lunch with our mom and hang out at the dog park while my dad and I slave away. 

Well, I was just dragged down there a few days ago, (and listen I get it, I'm not perfect, I have work to do, I am not fully independent, but I think I am better off than her at least) and we were laboring away. We were done for that saturday evening as my mom and sister returned, but we needed to come back at 10am on sunday to do some more work. She refused to let us come at 10am, saying it was too early and she needed her sleep, and to come at 1pm instead. 

At this point, I tell her in an irritated manner something along the lines of ""if you keep going at this rate, dad will be paying your rent well into your 40s"". My mom yelled at me something along the lines of ""at least she is independent and mature enough to live on her own unlike you"". I really did not say much back as my sister just called me a bully and my dad said I should not say rude things without purpose.

While I did not say much back, my mind was racing. First off, I thought it is high time for my sister to grow the hell up already. Secondly my mom saying that my sister's ""independence"" is better than mine is laughable. Firstly it is easy for her to say considering my dad is footing the bill for everything while my mom has done $0 as most women are in divorce. Secondly, while I would understand it if my sister was footing the bill, she is not. My sister racked up $120k ish for her liberal arts bachelor's degree that my dad foot the bill on. And you can see what she is up to now after college. Meanwhile I stayed at home, got a scholarship, and my bill was about $30k ish that my dad paid for for a bachelor's of science in business. I wonder which is the more mature path? Now I am getting a damn job. 

As for my sister's commentary, it is not even worth spending my time on. Lastly, my dad's comment is the only one that may have some merit, and ties into why I could potentially be the asshole. ""If there is nothing nice to say, don't say it"" is a famous saying, and me not abiding by that could hypothetically make me the asshole, but I think the circumstances surrounding everything make me not the asshole. But I am bias, so it is for you to decide. Aita?",,,,,2,2,2,2
171,"I (F, 27) am a current second year medical student, living in a house with 2 classmates. One of them, let’s call her Ali (F,27), I lived with last year in this house with a different third roommate. My/Our friend is the current third roommate, let’s call her Bea (F,28).

Throughout the school year we would have little random get togethers, and the pattern would always be that Ali would host and invite, leave a big mess, then literally leave for a camping trip and Bea and I would have to clean up together. If Bea and I hosted, we would always clean up after ourselves and our guests.

This year, Ali wanted to host again. Bea and I said okay to having people over but made it clear that we would not be part of the hosting, meaning we would not be doing the bulk of the cleaning. As the night was winding down (around 1am), Ali decides that she is leaving at 7am the next morning with her boyfriend to go on a trip. She asks if Bea and I will help with some cleaning since she won’t be able to. We agree to helping with SOME cleaning but still said this is your party and we’re not going to do all of it.

A proceeds to go back to the bonfire. Afterwards, Ali tells the guests that she’s tired, is going to bed and asks if they can clean up and put the fire out. This is about 20 drunken medical students, at someone else’s house, who are being asked to clean up and bring things into a house they have never been in. 

Ali leaves, showers, and goes to bed without once checking on our guests who are literally cleaning up everything outside. Meanwhile, Bea notices that the guests are stumbling around outside and rushes downstairs to help.

Next morning, Ali leaves at 7am. When I went downstairs, it smelled disgusting; trash, dirt, and leaves everywhere in the house. It almost looked how it did the night before.

Generally, I believe that the host should clean up after her guests, and be the last one up to say goodbye and make sure everything is okay. I’m not opposed to having people help out, but as host I feel it is rude to ask that of them and then leave.

I texted Ali the next morning about how the house was left and that I felt it was rude that she asked the guests to clean up and put out the fire. She called me in a huff, saying that “YOU agreed clean” and I said yes, I would help, but you’ve left us with literally everything. She then said that she spoke to Bea and that Bea had agreed to clean. I reiterated that I said we don’t mind HELPING but that this was not the first time she has done this. She had said when she went down in the morning everything was brought inside—and I was like yes, by Bea and everyone else, not you. 

She continued to send defensive statements that still did not address the fact that she left her own party and instead called me rude for “blaming her unfairly”. My friends and I all agree but in this regard, AITA?",,,,,1,1,1,1
172,"Ok.. This started Eastern. I (16M) have to cousins from my father side (12F and 9F). We seat together on the couch until my older Cousin S got up to get her phone. S started playing a game called ""gacha life"". 

I new it and I was the one to introduce it to her a few years ago. My younger Cousin M wanted to play too but S didnt wanted to play it herself so she didnt give M her phone. So I gave M my phone to play on it. I also had the game. Im a digital artist and I often use it to visualize ideas to draw.

She said thank you and started playing. I didnt pay attantion what she was doing but at first they were just creating diffrent Characters and showing them to each other.

Then after a bit I left for a few minutes and then got my phone back. I didnt really look into it. The other day I went into the app because I had a drawing idea. What I saw was something called ""Gacha Heat"". If you dont know what that is.. its basically 🌽. I was kinda shooked. But I just left it at first because I was visting my grandma again soon. Were I would talk with my aunt about it.

When I came to my grandmas S and M were there. My aunt was still working. S was playing Gacha again.. M asked me if she was allowed to play on my phone again. I said no. When my aunt came and M directly went crying to her. 

One thing is. M is the favourite in my aunts eyea and can do no wrong. I asked ro speak with my aunt under four eyes and talked her about what I found the last time after M olayed that game. My aunt tried to talk me into letting M play and say thats its not that bad. And even if. Its the fault of the game for allowing such things. I was speechless but stayes with my opinion to not let M play on my phone. 

My aunt and M was mad at me but at first I didnt care. But I talked with my mom about it and she said that I could have let M play but just have a closer look on her.

173,"I (15F) is the result of an accidental pregnancy, my mom (55F) gave birth to me when she was 40 which is not the ideal age, the doctor already told her that I would most likely be susceptible to illnesses and would have a high chances of being mentally retard ( I’m not btw)

Growing up, I was not a sick child mostly because I avoided things that I deemed unclean like mud, insect, sick peoples ( don’t worry I did grow out of it). But this still doesn’t mean that I in as good of a shape as a average child. When I started school, I was definitely in the nurse office more than the others. The average kid in my school get send home like at most 2 times a year, while I got send home 4 times/year. I understand that this is an inconvenience to my parents.

This trend of me being send home didn’t end when i started middle school. My mom was called just a few days ago to pick me up cause I have a painful stomachache. She took me to the hospital, they ran some test give me my prescription and I could get rid of that awful stomachache. However the ultrasound result showed no sign of anything wrong with me (Idk how this work, if anyone know pls tell). My mom was pissed. Yesterday, i got around 3 hours of sleep because I need to finish my schoolwork before being able to rest properly. This as a result make me extremely tired and i fell like i could just fal unconscious at any moment. I tried some coffee to see if i would help and it didn’t. So the break rolls around and i was beyond tired. I reluctantly went to the nurse. The nurse gave me some meds to help with the headache and nausea but I was still feeling terrible. So she told me to call my mom to let her know to come pick me up. I tried telling her that it’s a bad idea, that my mom would most likely yell at me and I tried convincing her to just let me stay ‘till school is over. But apparently that she is not allowed to do so so I gave in and called my mom. Before she even arrived, she yelled at me over the phone and when she finally got there she started yelling even more. On the way home, we got in to and argument. I won’t go into details but it essentially is just her telling me if i don’t want to go to school anymore I should just tell her and about how when she is my age she didn’t bother other like me and I’m just seeking attention. She told me that she doesn’t bother me when is sick then why am I bothering her with this. She said that she do everything alone then why can’t I ( In my defense, I’m not old enough to drive to seek medical attention like she can yet). She used some hurtful words and it honestly make me cry. I know parenting is hard and she is trying but I don’t think that I should be treated like this just because of a problem I can’t fix. She is threatening to put cameras in my rooms when i’m gone now and I do not consent to this, I feel like my personal boundaries should be respect and she don’t have the right to do this to me.

174,"My dad (60M) separated from my mom (59F) 4 months ago after she found out he was a sugar daddy and cheating on her with multiple women. She rightly kicked him out of the house. I (30F) kindly let him stay at my apartment temporarily until my parents sell their house and he gets his own place. I'm temporarily living with my mom in my parents' house. Side note: my dad is 100% a narcissist and was emotionally abusive to me, my sibling (28M), and my mom growing up so he is not a nice guy.

A week ago he asked me if I would be okay if he got a girlfriend one day, I said sure you're an adult, whatever...he claims he went to therapy after the separation and seemed like he was trying to be a better person as of late but it could just be an illusion. The question sounded more like: would I be upset seeing him date someone else other than my mom, not if I was okay with him using my apartment for his dates.

So I went to my apartment recently to grab some stuff while he was on a business trip (he gave me permission to go there whenever I want, I mean it is my place). I found women's lingerie, pyjamas, and a dress hanging in a closet where I store my luggage. So I felt super gross about the fact the he's having sex with someone in my bed in my apartment.

I texted him about it and at first he apologized but then passive aggressively said he felt uncomfortable when I had sex with my bf in my early twenties in a spare room in the basement so he said it was a similar situation and should have known better. Knowing how he is, I knew better and could tell he was trying to shift the blame from himself to me.

I'm wondering if I'm in the right to tell him to not have sex in my apartment, or if I'm being hypocritical?",,,,,3,1,1,2
175,"I have this friend who we’ll call Sandra (f20). We went to high school together and were really close until our friendship fell apart because she ghosted me after she got a boyfriend. In college we were reconnected by an mutual friend and became friends again. During that time I was going through a breakup and she obviously found out about it and immediately told my high school bully who she is close friends with. Sandra knows how much my bully hurt me (she turned all my friends against me, told people to not talk to me since I can’t make eye contact due to undiagnosed autism at the time, got someone to fight my 11 year old sister because she was mad at me). Despite this Sandra had always minimized my experience by saying that she doesn’t believe that happened since my bully was always nice to her. 

My bully then proceeded to create a fake Instagram page pretending to be my ex and would harass me on there until I blocked her. I knew this was my bully because I did the trick where you type in someone’s username and say you forgot your password and then their email pops up. The email matched my bully’s email. I confronted Sandra about this and she said she told my bully and other people about my breakup and told me how my bully kept asking her about a situation in my relationship which she discussed with her. Sandra apologized but I still feel really hurt by this because she felt so comfortable gossiping about a painful breakup to someone who she knows will use it against me. 

This happened a little less than a year ago and I only just remember this bc I was talking about being a people pleaser in therapy and my therapist brought up boundaries and how I don’t have to let people back into my life if they hurt me. I felt obligated to forgive Sandra since we have the same friend group and I don’t want to be on bad terms with anyone but what she did caused me to not trust her anymore. I want to put myself first because our friendship isn’t the best right now. It feels really one sided and when I ask to hang out she always claims she’s busy and reschedules but she has an excuse when the rescheduled day comes up.

177,"I (27 F) am living with a couple (22 F, 21 M). Previous living arrangement was with me living with my landlord (26 F) for about 9 months, who then wanted to rent out her room instead. Landlord had one meeting and I had a separate meeting(landlord wanted my input). I have some key things that I wanted to know because of previous bad roommate situations. One of these things is smoking. I have bad asthma and have a prescribed inhaler. I asked them if they smoke anything, they both said no. The rest of the meeting went well, so I agreed with my landlord that it would be a good match. First week of them living here, I immediately smell pot coming from their room. I give it a couple of days, smell did not let up. I called for a house meeting and reiterated, among many other things, to not smoke in the house. If you smoke, do it outside or in your car. The woman stated she can't smoke due to drug testing at work, and the man denied smoking. Later the male roommate asked me if it was okay to smoke blunts on the patio.... I told him that if it doesn't come into the house it is fine, but if I start getting sick, there's no way. I asked him why he didn't say that he smoked when I first met him, he shrugged and said he forgot. He told me that it was kind of ridiculous to ask him not to smoke, that's how he winds down after work. I told him that I really liked to breathe air. Sooooo.... AITA?

179,"So I (22F) live in an apartment with three other girls (all 22F). We have been living together for 4 years now and have become very close. Even after the first few months on knowing them, I have done my best to give them very personalized gifts for their birthday/Christmas. For me, gifts are my way of showing affection so I have always gotten them extremely personalized gifts that is tailored to them. They have always gone on about what an amazing gift giver I was and how I always seem to get them the perfect gift. But while I have been giving them very personalized gifts for their birthday and Christmas, I have never received one decent present from them. I feel a bit let down that none of my roommates have given me a single decent gift for my birthday and/ or Christmas. Let me explain first before you judge the word ""decent"".

The first gift giving thing we did was for Christmas. I went all over town and spent a good amount of time and money on personalized gifts (ex: hand-drawn portrait of them as their favorite character, typewriter music box, hand carved wooden turtle, etc) things that are so tailored to each one of them. None of them had a personalized present for me. The only present I got was a last-minuet gift that one of them had bought not even half an hour before (it was a single edible jelly). That was it.

During their birthdays I had gotten her, again, something personalized for her. Other roommates got her a nice bag and a new jacket. They had also set up a birthday decorations. When my birthday rolled around, I didn't get a single present from anyone. I just got the ""Happy Birthday"" text and we went out for dinner (separate checks). This cycle has continued to this day. Others got nice gifts from the other roommates for their birthday and a little party, I got no gifts from any of them and we went out for dinner (I don't even like going out for dinner). With Christmas, I got them personalized gifts that took a lot of time, thought and money, and I never received anything from them.

My 22nd birthday just passed, I had hoped (since this was the last time we would all be roommates before we graduate) that they would put in the same effort I always put in for them. But I got the usual text messages, we played a card game on the floor that night, and I got a Walmart cake. Not a single present. It really depressed me so much that I am putting in this effort for them but I can't receive anything.

I am not good at confronting people, but it has been something that has depressed me since year 1. Is this something I should mention or am I just being dramatic? I am genuinely looking for advice.",,,,,2,None,1,3

I kept getting more worried thinking women should help other women and look out for one another, and I was genuinely worried about these girls.

So I said ""Oh, I just wanted to make sure you're safe and not in a dangerous situation."" She caught major attitude (and maybe rightfully so) and said that she was completely fine, that the man was her dad, and wanted to know why I would ever think somethings wrong. In the end, she said ""I find that really offensive that you would think that"" and of course I apologized multiple times before she walked off angry... When she went outside she immediately told the man (her dad) what happened and he came in and spoke with my manager about it and said that it was a little hurtful but it was okay.

I'm not huge, but I definitely recognize it, and it's made me extremely self-conscious about what I wear and have breakdowns because of it. My mother has not helped this situation, though. She makes small comments and consistently talks about losing weight. She says someone asked her if I was expecting one time. So instead of just telling the lady no. She comes and pinches a couple of fat spots on my body and tells me someone thought you were expecting. She says she just doesn't want me to go through what she went through, and she doesn't mean to be hurtful at all. 

My wedding at the time of all this was 6-8 months away. I asked my mom to go wedding dress shopping, but she said I should wait to get closer to my goal weight, okay fine. Next, one day we were out shopping and I decided to make an appointment at a dress shop that same day, but she again said no. Lastly, while me and my fiance and I are out with his sister and family along with their friends. They asked how it's going so I asked my mom again. She responded and said, ""I'm not going to like the way they look on me and that I'm going to be discouraged with how they fit. I couldn't hold it any longer and started to cry. I tried so nobody would see me, but my suture SIL saw and consoled me. She said that we could have a girls' day and she'll take me. At this point, my anxiety is through the roof, with even being able to get a dress. 

What we decided was that I was going to have a girls' day with my future SIL, MIL, and my 2 future nieces. Im very close with them and feel a part of their family already. They just wanted me to finally feel special through this process because I nor fiance have through this process. I did on that day. Not thinking I was going to buy one, I found one that made me feel like a bride, and I loved it. I purchased it and made a plan that my mom wouldn't know it was bought prior to her seeing it. 

Things ended up happening where she found out. After finding out my mother texted me very upset and immediately started blaming me and that she'll never see my future MIL and future SIL the same because that is a special moment for mother and daughter. She even unfriended them on facebook... she says that I take everything the wrong way and that I've been a drama queen recently. Also, I've put my insecurities onto her. I know that I haven't been myself recently due to a lot of stress after being laid off. I recognized that and apologized to her for that. She says she doesn't know if she'll be at the wedding and absolutely won't be helping in any other way. Im completely heartbroken, and I'm terrified of the future family dynamic between our two families. There is a part of me who wants to call off the wedding as a whole so that my fiance and I can just go somewhere ourselves to be married.

Anywho, I had an idea about an actual school newspaper, including things like the meals for each day and trips coming up, study skills/motivation (in different sections) and such, and to update it every week online (because everyone has access to laptops and Wi-Fi at school). I thought it was a good idea and wanted to see it put into motion and then I was told that a grade above me planned a school newspaper earlier and were just sorting things out. I was bummed, but I didn’t want to basically steal the X chronicles from them. So I let it go.


They didn’t do anything about it for months. Until the end of the year when the principal said they’d print 1 newspaper for each classroom. Well, she left and the new principal denied the idea. I feel bad about it being denied but I feel like if I tried to do it my way, we’d be saving paper and everyone would have access to the news on their own at any time.

183,"I (and my dog) recently moved into my dad’s house. We’ve been here for about a week, and so far everything has been really nice. He lives in a large neighborhood with many families, children, and tons of other dogs.

This morning, I was letting my dog out to go potty (it was raining for the first time since I got here) in our front yard. It’s important to note that she did poop in the grass, but it was pretty much right in front of our front door, and at least 10 feet away from the sidewalk. I didn’t bring a poop bag out with me because I was holding her leash and an umbrella, and I also didn’t want her to be outside getting drenched in the rain any longer than necessary. My intention was to let my dog back into the house, dry her off, then come right back out to pick up the poop. With 100% honesty, I can genuinely say that I have NEVER just left her poop in the yard and not picked it up. I always pick it up instantly or come right back out with a bag once I let her back inside. If it’s your backyard, or if your front yard is secluded away so that children or other animals can’t get to the poop, it’s really not a big deal to me if you don’t pick it up right away, because that’s your own personal property. But when it comes to shared spaces, I absolutely despise people that just leave their dog’s poop in public spaces/other people’s yards and really think that they should not be pet owners. 

Anyhow, the very second that my dog finished pooping, my dad’s neighbor across the street opens her front door and starts yelling at me about how I needed to pick up the poop. She accused me of being lazy and not taking care of the neighborhood. This caught me completely off guard and I was just so appalled and taken aback that this woman (whom I have never met before) would say something so accusatory and rude, that I admittedly got a bit snarky back at her. I said, “Excuse me ma’am, mind your own business. This is my home, and I will pick up my dog’s poop when it is time for me to pick up my dog’s poop. Go back to bed.” (Because the woman literally came out in the rain in her nightgown and bonnet just to yell at me). 

I told my dad what happened and he sounded shocked. He said that this woman has baked him treats and cooked for him before, and that she was really nice. He was disappointed that I said something rude back to her because he was worried that she would stop feeding him. 

I know I shouldn’t have said anything to her. I’m normally the type to just kill people with kindness, but I think I was just so flustered and shocked that I impulsively said the first thing that came to mind. 

I’m still annoyed that she would accuse me of not taking care of my dog’s poop, but I do feel bad that I stooped to her level, and I might have ruined my dad’s relationship with his neighbor. But WIBTA for the way I responded to her, is she at fault for accusing me the way she did, or are we just both in the wrong in this situation?",,,,,,3,2,3
184,"I have just had stupid luck when it comes to dogs, my entire life. My siblings and I were put second to dogs growing up (8 dogs). As in, the dogs got steaks/beef every day while me and my brother were lucky to get ramen or a can of corn. They also took over our beds and we would be screamed at if we told them to get down so we could sleep (not only dogs but they had goats/rabbits/chickens indoors at night). Fast forward to age 16, I move out and end up with a guy who was the exact same way. Forcing me to sleep on the floor while pregnant so his old dog could be comfortable (we were young, broke and didn't have a couch). Or him getting his dog treats/toys versus our kid medication he needed. When that dog died he immediately got another and the cycle continued until I left (at 23). As I said, stupid luck. But regardless, this put a very bad taste in my mouth when it came to all animals, dogs especially.

My mother still has a bunch of dogs (5) and they still completely overtake her house. She has 3 couches and no where else to sit and those couches are basically the dogs domain. If the dogs are laying down, we all have to stand. She still has other animals indoors as well (goats and rabbits). Her dogs also have zero boundaries. If you are sitting, they will come over and get on top of you. My in laws are the same. SIL has 4 dogs and SIL is very much a ""it's their house"" type. So if the dog rips food out of the kids hands? Oh well, kid shouldn't of had food down low enough. Dog jumps on you? Deal with it, it's their house, not yours. Same with MIL, who only has 1 dog but he's huge and wildly untrained. Barreling through the kids constantly and jumping on me. MIL just laughs it off. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and he's knocked me down several times. 

Probably about 2 months ago I grew extremely resentful of all these people (my mom, MIL and SIL) and decided I would no longer associate because they treat me, my husband and my kids like 2nd class citizens in comparison to their dogs. I cut all contact basically, though I didn't block them. Just started ignoring calls. Over the past month my mom and MIL have invited me and the kids over and I've refused. When my husband asked why, I reiterated that I'm not going anywhere near them or their dogs. I'm all set. He said I'm being an AH because it's not like we have to deal with it for too long and could just stay a couple hours. I still refuse. AITA?",,,,,,1,1,3
185,"I (17) live with my parents.  As I’m sure most teenagers do, I have my fair share of conflict with my parents.  I don’t think it’s too bad, but definitely on the high end of normal.  Around April (or maybe late March) after a fight with my dad I texted him that for Father’s Day I would get him a gift worth $25.  Every time he did something (for lack of a better word) “wrong” I would text “-$1”.  I did this a few times and my dad would make a big deal of saying “I don’t care”.  Not to sound smug but he clearly did care.  This happened a few times and after one time I texted him “-$1” (nothing else, just that) and him and my mom were very mad at me.  He said it was “obnoxious” and my mom said “no reasonable person would do that”.  She then (smugly) said to ask my therapist what she thought (I’m in therapy mainly for parent-child conflict) and I said “I did and she didn’t have a problem with it”. My mom said “no reasonable person would be okay with that, she just probably didn’t want to have another battle with you”.  I’ve stopped for now because it’s not worth it with my parents, but I really don’t feel like I’m in the wrong here.  

So AITA?

Reason why I’m possibly TA: I know you shouldn’t hold a gift over someone’s head and also that he’s my dad

Edit: the reason I want to do this is because he never wants to talk about our fights.  There have been points where he’s gotten so angry that my mom eventually made him apologize and he never changes.  I’m punished all the time for fights and while I get to an extent there’s a parent child dynamics, nothing ever happens to him and there’s no enforcement so I was trying to “enforce” change here, just as he may punish me and hold my stuff over my head.

Second edit: For those saying that’s not how relationships work, I wouldn’t do this in any other relationship.  My parents are people that, not to sound ungrateful and I do love them, I’m stuck with.  I have some aspect of control in other relationships.  I don’t mean control like I control the other person, I mean it like a relationship works both ways and isn’t a stuck situation.  
*This is the one chance I have to have any kind of voice with my dad that will actually impact him*

More info: not that neuro type should define whether I’m TA but I am autistic, hence why my thinking is pretty tit-for-tat",,,,,,4,2,4
186,"My spouse has had a rough few months.  He lost his job in early February and hasn’t found a new one yet.  This weekend, we ended up dealing with some unexpected issues which affected our weekend plans, and he was no longer able to make a dish he had been planning to bring to a friend’s potluck.  As he left to get something ready-made from the store, he said “Just one more failure to add to my list of epic failures.” And I didn’t respond, because I’ve learned these last couple months that countering that kind of statement doesn’t help; it just prompts him to continue his negative self-talk.  For example, if I say, “You’re not a failure, you didn’t do anything to cause this,” he will just double down.  As he was leaving the house, he said “I guess that is what you think then” regarding the fact that I didn’t protest when he made the failure comment.  But I don’t believe he is a failure, I just don’t think it’s helping to respond to those comments anymore.  He’s been cold to me ever since.  I know he’s been feeling down, but it’s frankly exhausting to reply to those kinds of comments when it doesn’t seem to help.  AITA for not responding when my spouse talked about his “failures”?",,,,,,1,1,None
187,"My(F27) boyfriend(M25) said that I was rude for not saying “thank you” after he went out with the trash. I honestly don’t understand. 

So yesterday I cleaned, cooked and did both our laundry. He was sat gaming all day, that’s fine I told him to do what he wanted so that he wouldn’t be in my way when cleaning. I cooked dinner, cleaned the kitchen and organized the trash to take outside, I then asked him if he could take it outside and he said “yes before bed” and I said ok. Bedtime comes and the trash is still there and I think “ok, do I do it myself or what”. I asked him about it and he said tomorrow and I said ok. Tomorrow arrives and the trash is still there. And I think “I have to do this my self, but I only asked him for 1 thing and I do everything else around here” so I asked again when he was about to go out with the trash, he didn’t answer and when it was bedtime I woke up at 2 and he was going out with the trash in the middle of the night. 

He said today that he felt hurt that I didn’t say “thank you” when he took the trash out. I said that I am sorry he felt hurt and that I didn’t think about saying it. And he said he felt unappreciated and I said that’s sad, but if he could think of a time where he said “thank you“ to me for cleaning, cooking etc. he didn’t answer and said I was rude again.

So AITA for not saying “thank you” when my bf went out with the trash?",,,,,,1,1,1
188,"Background: Me and this person met while we lived in a different city and quickly grew close due to our circumstances there (new in the city, same life stage, worked from home so didn't have coworker friends, partners being in the same grad program). My partner and I moved back to our hometowns after he graduated and my friend and her partner decided to also move there as well. Not only did they decide to move to the same city but the same apartment complex we live in. I was very hesitant with this idea because I would feel obligated to invite them to every social event that happens since she's so close. I have grown up in this city and lived her all my life (except for the few years I was away while my partner was in school) so, I have many friends &amp; family here that I'm very close to. 

Ever since she moved in, I've tried including her in every way possible. However, after a few months of her being her, I started getting weird vibes from her. I took it as maybe she was having a hard time adjusting so, I sat down with her to see what's up. She then tells me that she felt like our friendship has changed from when we lived in the city where we met like, I would do things that made her feel left out and not include on purpose (like, spontaneous hangouts I would have at my place, not including her in a conversation). Mind you, I have created a life in this city for the past 20+ years and have family and many friends I've made prior to her moving here so, yes, I prioritize those 1x1 hangouts and don't tell her to come to every single social activity I go to because I may not feel comfortable with offering the invite. I have had conversations with her in the past about boundaries and I just feel like she keeps pushing me to loosen those boundaries I'm working so hard to keep. And her saying that makes me feel guilty and obligated to invite her to EVERYTHING isn't helping me want to stay friends with her. AITA??",,,,,,2,2,2
189,"When I (35, f) interviewed to move into this house, there were already two roommates, H (30, f) and L (30s, m). The lease had a two pet maximum, and I let them know I had two cats who would be coming with me. They agreed, and so did the landlord, meaning the 2-pet maximum had been reached. L did not mention to me at the time that sometimes his (technically ex) girlfriend K (f, 30s) comes over and brings her dog, F (f). 

When he started bringing the dog over, I was not informed, and they didn't think it would be a problem to let the dog around my cats. The cats would put their ears back and slink away. Once I saw this was happening, I let L and K know that I didn't want the cats around the dog. They told me, ""she lives with cats and she would never hurt them."" I said that while I believe them, the cats do not like it, and being stressed is not good for their health, so would they please shut the cats upstairs when they want to let the dog loose in the house? H backed me up and asked them to put the dog on a leash if they were just passing through the house on the way to L's bedroom.

As time went on, this request was sometimes followed, sometimes not. Sometimes I would come home to find that the cats and dog coexisting. It like they felt they only should do it if I would find out. Over time, the dog was over for weeks at a time, even if K was not there. 

Any time I tried to bring up my boundaries, I was met with the same disregard for my concerns. Because THEY believed their dog would not hurt the cats, they didn't feel it necessary. L had been PRESENT when the dog had started moving toward one of the cats and H had to stop her. The dog had also behaved aggressively toward a delivery man, when K had allowed her off-leash to run around the front yard while she was sunbathing nude in the back yard. Even after explaining that the behavior of dismissing boundaries was triggering to H and I, it didn't stop.

So then K gets another dog, a male. This dog, R, is more aggressive and they keep him on a leash. We even see him in a muzzle at one point. L tells H that he has, ""stranger danger issues we are working on"", but never informs me or introduces me to the dog, so it behaves aggressively toward ME. At one point, F needs surgery and I agree that she can recover at our house, but I put up barriers to divide the house into ""cat town"" and ""dog town"". I let him know this is temporary and, ""at no point will the cats and dog be in the same room.""

Then I come home one day and he's in the living room with the male dog on a leash and both cats. I text him that I am upset and he responds that ""he was on a leash"" and he now has ESA paperwork for this dog and it will be staying with him. He led us to believe the dog belonged to K while he got this paperwork to FORCE us into a situation he knew we were not comfortable with. I used to consider L a friend, and now H and I can't trust him. I am going to do everything in my power to get him out of our house. AITA?",,,,,,1,1,1
190,"Setup: Me (23f) Ex/Father of child(22m) 
Child (2f; no childcare during the summer, school in the fall) 
So let’s dive in. About 2 months ago he lost his job and did nothing but sit at home and play video games until 5 in the morning. Slept until 2 in the afternoon. Barely lifted a finger to pull cat hair out of his own beard. Barely showered. Was a good father, spent time with the child outside of video games daily, made sure she was always fed, changed, bathed, tended too. Personal hygiene, income, and tending the house on the other hand? Horrific. I ended up having to work more to keep up with bills and trips we had wanted to take this summer, and take care of the entire house, yard etc. I’ve noticed these patterns for a long time-He hasn’t touched the lawn mower since we moved in a year ago and we just renewed the lease. (Our first home together- yay) Shit hits the fan. Quite obviously. We aren’t together and haven’t been for about a month now. Living together in civility for the child- we do not sleep in the same room and we strictly only discuss things related to the child. I agree with these terms as does he and it has gone smoothly 89% of the time. He finally gets a new job as a key holder at a corporate chain store, and told me that he has to have his availability totally open, and left it at that. No compromise, no offering his new manager my schedule, no time for me to cut down the hours I’ve picked up recently (within a week time span). I get his schedule Saturday. It conflicts with mine so badly we need a babysitter EVERY day this week. After not needing or having childcare for 2 months. I am now showing up 2 hours late to my 6 hour shift because he works 8-5 today. WIBTA if I told him that it is up to him to find childcare for the time that he has to work after all this? 
Side note: In the 3 years we were  together, he never took a single day off because we didn’t have a babysitter. I have always had to call in late or call out of work. He always blames it on me and says ‘I’m a manager’ also- I am keeping the house, him here or not. -he hasn’t paid bills or utilities in 3 months.

191,"Bare with me here. 

My (23 they/them) sister (26) and I share a car. We split payment evenly. However, she currently is not working and I am, so I’m paying 100% of the car despite still sharing use of it with her. 

I’m the youngest of my siblings and frequently feel like I am treated as if I’m still a kid by them, but especially by her as she somewhat raised me. It’s frequently noticed by others that she still acts like my mom despite the fact I’m 23. 

I’ve been talking with my therapist about the desire to become more independent and able to go where I want without constantly having to tell people where I’m going or when I’ll be back. She’s agrees with me that it’s no one’s business as long as it doesn’t interfere with other plans. 

If I’m gone longer than expected, she virtually always sends me a text checking if I’m okay or rather just asks “you dead?”

If I’m gone for like five hours and she doesn’t know where I went in the first place, I could probably understand this. 

The issue is that we both know each other’s schedules. We have a calendar we write appointments and other things on so we know when to schedule things and not overlap. Obviously though life isn’t on a schedule so I might decide to go get dinner or stop for lunch on the way home from a doctor’s appointment. 

Which is basically what happened today. I had my first appointment with a new doctor 20 minutes away. Meaning a forty minute total drive and what anyone would assume an appointment that lasts at least an hour. Meaning at the absolute earliest, I would be home at around 2:40. I stopped on the way home to get ice cream as it’s a beautiful day. 

My sister texts me at 3:20 asking if I’m dead. 

When I get home I told her that while I appreciated the concern, she doesn’t need to ask if I’m dead when I arrive home 40 minutes later than she expects. I also told her she just generally doesn’t need to do that as I don’t need to tell her where I’m at or when I’m getting home. 

She got defensive and explained it’s not crazy to check that I didn’t get in a car accident if I’m gone for too long. 

I told her that if I was a car accident she would hear about it but that I’m an adult and considering I’m paying for the entirety of the car right now, it’s not really reasonable that she needs to know where I’m at or when I’m getting back if she doesn’t have a prior commitment.  

Eventually she just said she didn’t want to get into it and changed the subject. 

So AITA for telling my sister she doesn’t need to check in on me?",,,,,,1,1,None
192,"I (30F) have been married to my husband (32M) for 6 years and we have both always enjoyed drinking socially and just casually. The issue I have is that he misses work sometimes when he drinks, and when I express how I am upset with him about it he tells me how I drink too and it’s not like he misses work all the time. He used to miss work a LOT. But it has improved, but it is starting to happen more often again. 

I have not gotten upset with him for awhile over it because he gets sad and starts saying how he’s mad at himself too. But this is the second time he’s done this in the past month and I don’t want it to be a habit again. So AITA for getting upset?

EDIT: I believe I might be the asshole because I have missed work in the past because of drinking, but I corrected it because I don’t want that to be a habit I carry out. But I have still done it so maybe I’m being a hypocrite.

EDIT 2: Haven’t gotten the verdict yet but I’m going with ESH because I should also just stop drinking altogether. If I can slow down I can stop overall. I don’t want this to be the warning sign to stop that I ignored.",,,,,,2,2,1
193,"I've been living with my roommate (25f) for a year now. We were friends in college and decided to move in together.

Initially, everything was going well. I'm not a messy person and have never had any issues with previous roommates. However, my roommate is very particular about cleanliness (i.e likes to vacuum, sweep, wipe counters daily). So, I made an effort to adjust to her habits. She was generally kind and invited me and my partner to dinner, bars, jazz concerts, and more. Her and her bf often paid for things, despite our attempts to pay them back. I didn't think much of it at the time and appreciated their generosity.

Over time, I found myself juggling two jobs, studying for a certification, and preparing for the GRE. My free time was scarce, but I tried my best to make time for my roommate. I invited her over for dinner parties with my partner, went out for drinks, and had coffee dates when possible. However, as I was working two minimum wage jobs, it was challenging to be as generous as she and her boyfriend had been.

One night, we were supposed to go clubbing together, but I was too tired and had to cancel at the last minute. The next day, my roommate sent me multiple paragraphs explaining how disappointed she was and how she had to lower her expectations of our friendship. I apologized and promised it wouldn't happen again. She then said that she felt loved when people made intentional time for her, and I assured her that I would try to accommodate my schedule to see her more often.

My schedule became even busier with time, but I tried my best to make time for my roommate. However, during our hangouts, I noticed that she made derogatory jokes at my expense and spoke to me condescendingly. At first, I laughed it off, but it began to bother me. It started with jokes about things I wasn't good at, but they expanded to criticisms of my partner and friends.

I confronted my roommate about her hurtful words, and she explained that she didn't mean to be negative and often said things without thinking. She then brought up her offense at my relationship with my partner. She said that she barely knew him despite our long-term relationship and that I never made an effort to introduce them, unlike her bf. She also complained that I never expressed gratitude for all the things she and her bf paid for me. She listed every item, including dinners, mover fees, and shared goods from her past apt. The total cost was over 2k. I was shocked and confused because I had offered to pay for everything, but she had refused. When I asked if she wanted me to reimburse her, she angrily said that she never asked for my money.

The next day, she sent me a long text accusing me of being a terrible friend and not reciprocating her efforts. She even included a copy of the itemized list. She said I didn't deserve her friendship, and she was burned out because of my lack of awareness. I feel terrible for hurting her, but I don't know where it all went wrong.

He had been at her house for a party this weekend and M had asked him harmless questions, but then he just stood up and left and texted M that he couldn't handle the questions and that he felt like she interrogated him and that she made him have a panic attack. M tells me that she think he was acting immature and told him that he was acting like a child and that she didn't want him to be a part off her life anymore.
I told my sister that it's okay I'd she doesn't want him in her life anymore she decides that, but she shouldn't have been so mean to him because she doesn't know if he might be struggling with some sort of anxiety. She said no he isn't, she has known him for 2 months and he does not have anxiety. I then told her that she can't know that, he can hide it from everyone and besides 2 months is not enough time to really know another. She disagreed and I just didn't want to have that discussion. But then she continues telling me that he is childish because he is diagnosed with ADHD and that he can't help being childish. I told her she can't blame it on ADHD and that she can't just call him childish just because he couldn't handle she questioning him.

She then said that I don't know that I don't know everything. I knew then that she was trying to get a reaction out of me and told her that if she is done I'm going to hang up.

The thing is, that I feel bad for snapping at her. I'm usually calm towards her when she acts out like that.

Today we had our first dress rehearsal, this consists of me and my other band mates practicing on stage so we can adjust our volume and able to point out mistakes we can’t really make out in a crammed class room.

Our rehearsal needless to say went ok, but i noticed that every time we needed to stop, it’s because our flute section keeps playing either too early or too late. I’m in percussion so it doesn’t really affect me that much, but for others, it does because people lose track of where their parts are if certain parts aren’t on time.

We have a band group chat where we notify each other of band meets coming up, gigs, etc. One of my band mates texted the group chat saying that we did a great job today and to continue practicing. Later on, I texted the group chat and this is how it went:

me: flutes, please make sure you guys practice as well. i know it’s even more stressful on you guys considering almost all of y’all are seniors and the concert is coming up fast. but once this is over it’s smooth sailing from here ??

200,"So I (22m) have a friend that we will call Eric (23m) whom I have known since we were little kids. We have always been very good friends and we still hang out regularly. Growing up together, we had a bond that I didn’t have with many other friends. For some backstory, I am Asian and he is white, and when we started getting into our teens he started making a lot of asian jokes and digs at me. In front of all of our friends, in the group chats, basically anywhere he could insert an offensive Asian joke to or about me, he would do it. I never cared too much about it and I always just shake it off. Sometimes it would bother me, but I never acted angry because that would only make him do it more. 

For some more backstory, Eric was never the brightest student. Always skipping class and falling behind in school. It was safe to say he was not very book smart. I have always been an A student, and I will be graduating college with an electrical engineering degree this month. Our freshman year, Eric dropped from his community college within the first semester because he couldn’t handle the work. I never made any mention of this nor did I tease him about it. 

Anyways, a couple days ago, we were hanging out with some friends and having a mild debate about an irrelevant topic which would take too much explaining for how dumb it was. Regardless, Eric, after claiming he was right and I was wrong, says “Damn, I thought you Japs were supposed to be smart.” To which I replied, “Says the guy who couldn’t get through one semester of community college.”

Eric got mad, saying I am way out of line and left. My other friends thought it was funny but Eric hasn’t communicated with any of us since. Was I the asshole here?",,,,,,3,1,3
201,"My mom just turned 60 and is applying for a federal pension. Her partner retired so she is taking the pension early to help improve their household income (which I think is silly because she would get more at 65…)

She took time off from working during my childhood to care for my sister (who has two severe disorders). Due to this she will be excused for not working during the time she cared for my sister. 

Today she has been hassling me to give her my social insurance number. She is convinced having my information on there will get her more money. I live on the opposite side of the country and would have to give it to her over phone or email/ text - which I am not comfortable with. I told her I would enter it into the form when she visits next month. She told me she needs it right away or she won’t get a payment this month. I told her to give me her login information and I will enter it myself. She responded with, “but then I will have to give you my personal information!” And I told her she had to take the risk, not me, if she was screwed over by her own poor planning. 

She is pretty angry at me now. My husband on the other hand is glad I stood up for myself and refused to surrender my SIN. But I am still wondering, AITA?

(he has a different mom, who also divorced my dad) and last but not least, my mom(45). 

The problem is that my step-dad(who we'll call sp) will forbid my mom from attending if he isn't there, and she will obey, she missed my sister's graduation because sp said that he felt uncomfortable being in the same room as my dad so I have no reason to believe otherwise.

203,"I (32M) have always had a strained relationship with my father. He and my mother divorced when I was around 3 and I split time between them as a child but spent more time with my mother. 

As a child, my father spent a lot of time bashing my mother and badmouthing her, along with spending a large amount of time drunk and high on who knows what. He is an admitted alcoholic and drug addict, having done hard drugs from his teen years through his 40s until his body started shutting down (around the time that I was 16). He did not have much money due to child support and his habits that he fueled (not important to be but important for context).

8 years ago, in 2015, I was admitted to a psychiatric facility and he refused to visit because he said “he could not handle seeing me like that” and I essentially stopped having much contact with him after that. My mother has encouraged me to keep the line of communication open despite everything because she doesn’t want me to have any regrets. 

He is 63 now and we do not have much of a relationship. He has memory issues so I have never felt like it was worth mentioning any of my issues with him. We do not have much in common and phone calls/visits are a struggle. He has almost died 3 times and I’ve had to see him admitted to many hospitals because of his reckless decisions. 

Recently, we had a phone call where he voluntarily declared he “didn’t feel like he was meant to be a parent and he didn’t feel like he had done a very good job of raising me.” I asked him if there were any regrets he felt like addressing given that statement, as I felt like maybe he was in poor health or something and wanted to open that dialogue (finally). 

He replied with “No, not really.”

No acknowledgement that he’s proud of who I’ve become, and no apology or ownership for any of his behavior. 

With Father’s Day next month in the US, I’m considering just not acknowledging the day and just letting it pass. He does not feel like he was meant to be a dad - should I just send a simple text on the day? WIBTA if I just don’t say anything?",,,,,,1,2,1
204,"My (f21) sister (f24) and I have a close relationship, never had a issue between us. 

She has been dating a guy (m24) for a few years now.They are living together. Two weeks ago we went to eat together (just me and her), she told me they were having issues again, she said she feels drafted away from him. I told her that it's just because of this issue they're having, they need to work it out and she'll be close to him again. She told me it's not that, she said she doesn't feel attracted to him anymore and she's feeling confused. 

I asked what exactly did she meant, I thought that she liked another guy or something. She told me that she has been getting very close to a new friend she has, let's call her Camilla (f23). They are working together, they have met around 5/6 months ago. She told me she's feeling a different way about her, not like she felt with any other friend. She told me she's been thinking about it and maybe she is attracted to women. Then she started telling me about what Camilla and her do, and honestly it does sound like she's emotionally cheating. I told her she should be honest with her boyfriend and tell him the truth because now shes just waisting his time. She told me she has to think about it more, because she likes living in their apartment and she knows she wouldn't be able to afford it by herself. So basically she's just using him. We kinda had an argument about it.

Well, she had not tell him any of it, and I feel bad for him, so I told him the truth. Long story short, they argued and he kicked her out. She's living with our parents now. She called me and told me I am an asshole for not keeping her secret and called me homophobic. AITA?",,,,,,3,2,4
205,"
I, (F16) recently went on a trip to Boston to celebrate my Uncle’s (Jeff) (29M) graduation. It was a 3 day trip and my mom (F41) and my little brother were going. The trip was on my birthday so everyone decided that after the graduation, we would celebrate my birthday.

Jeff recently got married to a woman (Jenny) (28F) Me and Jenny have always been polite to each other, I don’t consider her close family but I respect her as my uncles wife. 

The first day of the vacation, everyone met together at a restaurant. I  said hi to everyone before sitting down.

Later on the first day on the way to the hotel, we had time to kill so I followed Jenny, Jeff, and my little brother to the bookstore. I picked out two hardcover books and spotted Jenny in line and asked her to hold onto them for me while I go find my Uncle and get permission to buy them. She said okay and I went outside to look, and when I couldn’t find him I asked Jenny where he might be.

She told me she could just buy the books for me, I said she didn’t have to if she didn’t want, and she insisted and said I should consider it her birthday gift to me. I thanked her. I didn’t think there was an issue.

The second day was the graduation. We all met at a breakfast restaurant and ate. After we all finished, Jeff asked what I’d like to do for my birthday and I said something fun, so he suggested the theme park. I said yes, but Jenny said she didn’t like theme-parks and we had to do something else. Jeff was insisting on the theme park, and eventually Jenny got mad and said she had to work and stormed off. 

Once me and Jeff got to the car, I was very excited, but while I was in the car waiting to go my mom walked up and I opened the door, and she started yelling at me for ‘demanding Jenny buy me gifts’. I didn’t know what she meant and she said I had no right to boss my aunt around. I asked her what she was talking about again, and she said the books I forced Jenny to buy. 

I tried to tell her what happened but she walked away. The next time I saw Jenny was at the graduation and asked to speak with her in a quiet area. 
I asked why she lied to my mom about the books, and she said she didn’t think I deserved to go to a theme-park with my horrible attitude.
I explained I thought I had been nice to her and everyone else.

She disagreed and said yesterday at the restaurant i didn’t say hi to her, which she thought was rude because we were family.
I apologized even though I felt like it was weird nonetheless she was so mad, and she never spoke to me at the restaurant to let me know.

She didn’t say anything else and went back to the rest of the family. The rest of the trip I was sad because my mom was upset at me and Jenny didn’t speak to me.

TL;DR: My aunt offered to buy me books during a trip in Boston and she told my mom that I demanded she buy them.

I really wanna know, AITA?",,,,,,1,1,1

I get it problems happen but, my problem was when nothing was happening she would say to me ""I will call you on x day"" never does a lot of times and for some reason this got to me personally and reminded me of how my pathological liar uncle used to lie to me and make false promises all the time then she said it the final time (she would usually call my grandma and they talk endless about jw related stuff and then when the conversation ends she says ""I'll talk to him on x day"" and she fails to do so and when she does she goes through my grandma first then me when she could've called me. so I got sick and tired of it and I called her 30 mins after she called my grandma and I told her about it I said ""we have a problem"" ""what's the problem""  I said ""can  you stop saying you'll call me and come over when you don't and just say if you can't call or make it just tell me instead of not saying anything"" and she was like I have to stop you there and yelled at me and got defensive and said "" don't tell me what to do"" and mentions that she vist the hospital when she mentions it and I said ""I get but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about when your free"" she yelled some more and randomly mention Jehova and  threatened to end our case and bring the papers and ended the conversation yes I get it was 12:30 am but she was literally talking to my grandma not that long ago 2 days later she says she gonna bring the papers to me.. was I wrong for saying how I felt? should I find another case manager?",,,,,,1,1,1
208,"My roommate (21F) and I (20F) have spent  the spring semester in dorms, and things were going smoothly.

When setting up boundaries and rules for one another, we agreed upon having a shared pantry/food and snacks area.

Knowing how badly the food at my campus hurts/irritated my stomach, I decided to put some money in monthly ($100 per month) towards groceries such as cereal, noodles, almond milk, and more to keep me nourished for my major (a very physical one).

This idea of halving the food went well at first. I did not mind her taking from the pantry occasionally, and at one time she had a cheese itz box that I could eat from. However, that was it. At one point she stole 3 of my noodle cups (that I personally kept on my shelf that wasn’t to be shared) in one night and ate them all. However, since she told me she had a bad day and needed something to eat I didn’t pay much mind. From time to time I would also notice my food going away faster than usual. 

My feelings towards sharing started shifting when I had ordered entire pizzas for myself and her. On two occasions I chipped in all my money for a pizza, was promised to be paid back, but never was. And when she ordered pizza I split the check. The next day when I was hungry and had no meal swipes left, I noticed and asked if I could borrow some food from her. Which she has (kraft mac and cheese cups and other stuff she personally keeps). I was rejected and told “I don’t have any snacks.”

Now that i’ve bought groceries again i’ve kept them on my side out of her reach without explanation. It’s the end of the semester, so I didn’t feel like having a discussion would be useful.

210,"The other day, I was walking my dog through my neighborhood. I happened to be on the phone.

Suddenly, a truck pulled up next to me, and the woman motioned for me to stop and come around to her window. The interaction went something like this:

""Is this yours"" as she shook the dog poop bag in my face.""Uh, maybe. It looks like my bags.""""Don't throw your dog's shit in my trash can. That it so unbelievably rude. I don't shit in your trash can. It's so disrespectful for you to think that leaving this in my trash can is okay.""

I hadn't taken my headphone out before walking to her window, so while I was talking to her, the person I was on the phone with was also talking. There was so much going on, I was having a hard time processing the already ridiculous situation.

I was truly stunned. She handed me the poop bag (along with a questionable paper towel) and I took it out of reflex. I sincerely apologized and she drove away. It was such a strange interaction, I didn't know what else to do.

Here's the thing, though - it was trash day. Her trash can was on the curb. I didn't go out of my way to find her bin, and the poop would have been in there for 4 hours max before the truck came to empty it.

So, did she see me put the poop bag in there, and then jump in her car to chase me down? She found me like 5 minutes later, so she really committed to this bit.

Was this rude? It's not a huge deal to me to just carry the poop bags somewhere else,  and in the future, I won't use her trash can, obviously. But what's the consensus?

211,"I’m a single mom with 2 kids, working 2 jobs. I’m divorced but have been dating a man for a few years. 

My boyfriend recently got me a 10-week-old puppy for my birthday, and I said no and asked him to return it to the breeder. I know I can’t handle that responsibility. Raising 2 kids alone, working 60 hours a week, and maintaining my home are more than I can handle as it is, so a puppy is the last thing I need! 

My boyfriend is now upset and not speaking to me. He says he’s insulted and mad, and that because I said I wanted a dog and the dog he got me (as a total surprise, without discussing it with me first) is super cute and sweet that I should want it. He says the fact I don’t means I’m a liar and he can’t trust me!

I love dogs and sometimes mention that I’d love to have one again someday (had a dog before I had kids and really miss having one — they’re the best), and I occasionally look on Petfinder for adult dogs in shelters, but I recently stopped doing that because I knew I couldn’t adopt until my kids were off to college. 

This is making my head spin. How does he not get that I don’t want an extra mouth to feed and 15-year commitment? You can’t just surprise someone with an animal! It’s a living thing with needs. I actually tried for a day to do it, because he was so excited and the puppy was so cute, but I couldn’t take it longer than 24 hours.

I know this is the right choice for me and my family right now, but his reaction makes me wonder if I’m an a$$h*le.

212,"Hello Reddit, long time reader, first time poster. I (32 F) have a friend (27 F), let’s call her Mary. We’ve been friends for about 4.5 years, ever since I moved to our city from my home state in 2018. Lately, we’ve both been pretty busy with work and life, etc. so don’t see each other often, but text on and off and keep in touch every few days. 

Recently, we were chatting via text about our weekends, and she mentioned to me that she was in Illinois and about to hit up a dispensary, did I want her to grab me anything while she was there? I said yes please! After quickly cruising the website I picked a few items and sent them her way asking if that would work. $50 exactly. I then said I’d send an extra $10-$15 to cover taxes, and of course thanked her. She texted back saying “can you do $30 extra? For my gas and my time?” I was a little confused by this because a) she was already going to the dispensary, it’s not like I asked her to make a special trip for me (or even knew she was out of state in the first place), and b) she had offered to pick them up herself. I texted her back lightheartedly and asked “aren’t you already there? Lol” to which she replied, “hahaha well mama gets to pick her price tbh haha”. At that point I told her I was good this time around but thanked her for the offer. She was pretty short with me after that, and we ended our conversation.

We haven’t spoken since, and it’s been almost a week. I know it’s not a lot of money, and it’s not even about the money to me. It just feels like this is a common theme with her as of late and it’s beginning to feel like my kindness is being taken advantage of. I spoke to my sister and a different friend and they both think I’m not the asshole, and that she was trying to squeeze extra money out of me under the guise of niceness, but I tend to have a people pleasing nature and get caught up wondering/feeling like i’m in the wrong.

213,"So my Mum (53) and I (15) recently took a holiday together and during the flight back I convinced her to watch House of the Dragon (I’ve already watched it). She really enjoyed the first 5 episodes and so she finished the series of the next couple of days after we were back home.

She really enjoyed the show and so after the finale ended I instantly loaded up Episode 1 of Game of Thrones (the show’s chronological sequel) and she watched it and enjoyed it. We manage to get past the nudity by having me turn around or stuff my head in a pillow. The 18+ parts of the show are not causing the issue here.

Anyway it’s all going well so far, right?

Well then it took about a week of me asking her to watch it before she finally agreed to watch Episode 2. I don’t see what was stopping her from wanting to watch it, she said she was busy. However, after agreeing to watch the second episode, my mother only got halfway through before she ‘became busy’ again. It then took another week of me begging her for her to agree to watch Episodes 2 and 3. That was 2 weeks ago, we are yet to continue.

Let me explain the issue here. I’d understand if she were too busy or too stressed from work to watch it with me. What annoys me is that she seems fine to watch any other show possible. We live in England and yet somehow she’s managed to watch 3 whole MLB games. She also watched an entire musical with my sister. She’s continuing all of her other series and she’s even starting new ones. Yet every time I ask her to watch Game of Thrones she tells me the reason she won’t watch it with me is because “[I] keep asking too much and nagging [her]”. She also only works part time at the moment and I’ve told her numerous times that I’m happy for her to watch it while i’m at school.

I’m only nagging my mother because it is annoying me that she seems happy to watch anything else with anyone else but won’t watch anything with me. We’ve watched loads of similar shows over the years and she has never had an issue with those shows or me asking her daily if we could watch an episode.

It seems that every time I ask I have a lower chance of watching it with her but if I don’t ask she just won’t watch it with me.

AITA? This has been annoying me for weeks.

EDIT: She insists she enjoys the show and she really liked House of the Dragon.",,,,,,1,1,3
214,"I (27F) have never been *that* close with my family. From years of familial trauma to my own need for reclusion in my free time (I have a moderately stressful job), I usually see my father once every 3 months and my mother once or twice per month. I speak to my mom daily and my dad 1-2 times per week via phone. This has been the norm for quite some time. 

For additional context, my father lives 2 hours from me and my mother lives 30 minutes away. My sister lives about 2.5 hours away.

Since my sister (32F) has gotten married in January, she has been driving to see my mom nearly every weekend and pressuring me to do the same. Her new husband sees his parents every weekend, so I assume that to be the cause.

My partner of five years works a demanding job and I usually reserve the weekends for our time together with our dog. Prior to that, I was in grad school full-time while simultaneously balancing a full-time job up until last December, so I did schoolwork all weekend for two years.

Nowadays, whenever my sister contacts me, it’s out of anger to tell me that I should be making more of an effort to be with my parents. I find spending time with my family to be pretty unbearable—my mother is emotionally unstable and my father is a narcissist. Plus, any time I take my mother out for special occasions she is rude to waitstaff and often complains/tries to get discounts, hence why I hardly want to go out with her. My father, on the other hand, makes comments about my appearance and always leaves me feeling far worse after seeing him.

To be transparent, I feel very detached from my family and can understand where my sister is coming from. I make minimal effort to spend time with them unless I absolutely have to.

I love my sister, but I’m extremely tired of feeling guilty for not wanting to be with my family as often as she does. AITA?",,,,,,1,2,None
215,"&amp;#x200B;

So I 20F was best friend with this girl also currently 20F. We met during high school and were in the same group of friends, though we would acknowledge each other, we weren’t friends until lockdown in march 2020. 

During lockdown, I learnt that she was having trouble in her relationship, her bf was also an acquaintance of mine. Therefore, it felt appropriate to send her a text saying I was sorry and that I was there if she needed a shoulder to cry on. 

I didn’t think she would take this seriously as we barely knew each other but she did. From now on it was constant texts, phone calls and audio notes, I didn’t care, I was happy I could help. At that time I was also facing some issues of my own but being very private and not wanting to burden her as she was already facing so much with her breakup, I kept those information for myself.

Then lockdown was over and we were practically attached to the hip, talks about her ex were slowly disappearing but we weren’t talking less, if not more and seeing each other every day. When I wasn’t replying for too long without warning she would worry a lot and I needed to be available 24/7.

Yet, these amazing phases cannot go on forever and the first fight appeared when she was invited to a party with all of our friends and I wasn’t. I was 16 at the time and during the previous party I threw up because I drank too much and they said I couldn’t control myself that is why I wasn’t invited anymore. My best friend didn’t say anything and didn’t try to get me invited. Though, I got her invited a few weeks prior when nobody wanted her around because her ex was throwing the party. I didn’t care about the others, I couldn’t picture myself having fun without her.

I was hurting a lot and don’t think I really forgave her as I have big trust issues, but I loved her too much to stay mad forever, so I tried.

From now on we had a lot of fights, over stupid things but anything would make me hurt. It seemed we didn’t get each other anymore. But we would always kiss and make up because we couldn’t live without the other.

At some point, in December 2020, she started seeing a guy from our class, I wasn’t too found of the guy but whatever, it wasn’t my place to judge. When she announced me she was dating him she said she couldn’t stand the fights we had anymore and cut ties, my family issues were stronger than ever and I hurt a lot from that decision. Though she rapidly regretted (during the 2 months where we stopped talking she would send me fake texts and pretend it wasn’t for me etc…).

At a friend’s birthday party we kissed and made up and promise never to leave each other anymore. It lasted for a week. She knew I was feeling down but she was in a relationship and therefore didn’t really care, her bf was first and if there was a little time left she would reply to my texts.

Each time I proposed to hangout (she wasn’t proposing anything anymore) she would say she’s too busy and then I would see her and her bf in the city. When I talked to her about issues I was facing (anorexia, family problems) she would say “I’ll listen to your audios later” and then never would. 

So I confronted her, a lot, but nothing changed. I said I was happy she had a boyfriend but that doesn’t mean you have to let your friends down because remember who held you and wiped your tears when the first one left you. She said I couldn’t understand what she felt because I never fell in love. Meanwhile, she was begging me to talk to her instead of keeping it all for myself until it exploded.

I know I wasn’t pleasing during that time, whenever I was mad I would leave her on read for long hours, I was acting cold and distant instead of communicating. I was hurting so much that I had become a real pain in the ass. 

It kept having ups and downs always over the same shit until her birthday party where she almost didn’t invite me because we were fighting and she said it’s the last straw. I still got invited, her bf was there, for the first half of the party my best friend and I weren’t talking to each other until we were left alone on the back deck where we hugged and said sorry.

Her boyfriend saw us. Later, we were both drunk and I was lazily laying on her on the couch while she was stroking my hair. That happened all the time, we would always cuddle. Her boyfriend got mad and said, talking about me “When is she gonna leave ???” My best friend told him to let me be until he dragged her to the bathroom because she was feeling sick, all while violently removing me from her, I had bruises for a while after that.

I was shaken about what happened and walked past them in the kitchen to go outside saying I needed a cigarette he replied with “Yea and you better sleep outside too”. My best friend heard but didn’t react, she was in his arms during that and kept telling him she was sorry for drinking so much (he absolutely hates alcohol and criticizes the ones who drink it).

The next morning she sent me a text saying anything between her and I was over. I cried and cried. She sent a text a few days later saying she regrets and she doesn’t want to lose me, I had hope and she never texted back…

After that, I wrote her a 20 page letter 6 months later to explain anything I was feeling. She replied through WhatsApp 2 months after saying “I wanted to tell you I read your letter”. That’s it. We had little to no contact ever since. It has been over since a year and a half and I’m still hurting. I don't know if she is still with her boyfriend.

Maya has one habit that drives me crazy: she will ignore almost any texts I send to her.  No matter whether it's something casual or something more important, she almost never responds.  (Meanwhile she does pretty regularly text me, and I always respond.)  Obviously with work and family it may not always be possible to respond right away, but she doesn't respond at all, not even the next day or the day after.

I've tried to make clear to Maya that this bothers me, several times.  It makes me feel used.  It feels like she can reach out to me whenever she wants my company or support, but when I try to do the same, she feels free to ignore it.  I've said this many times, and usually Maya apologizes and says she'll do better, but she never does.  In practice, I've mostly just stopped reaching out, unless it feels urgent and can't wait until we next meet up.

My partner worked hard to afford this place, he doesn’t want to move.

- our first home is more of a starter home (it’s not a lot of space) 
- our condo fees are high 
- I wanted to buy a larger unit from the start, but at the time of purchase my partner was making far less than now
- I work remotely from the den, and it doesn’t have a window or any natural light and it’s depressing
- I want to use our condo’s appreciation as a down payment on a bigger one in ten years. 

Partner’s Perspective: 
- we can retire early and travel
- it was expensive to buy this one 
- costs associated with buying and selling are high
- furniture might not fit as well in the next unit

It kicked off in my kids sports group. 
This Person Trevor we shall call him. Decided to have a go at the groups coaches. Who hadn’t done or said anything wrong other than having to change the training for the week, due to family emergency. 
(First time they have ever changed training. This coach even turned up 2 hours after his wife gave birth when he didn’t need too.) 

Trevor kicked off and told them they were selfish and told no wonder the boys were struggling to win a game and that his child was being let down by team mates and coaches. (He implied that his child was the best. The comment was no read very well between all the parents who wasn’t happy he was slamming other people’s children down. His child isn’t anything special and all though he is good he’s not better than the rest of them. They are all equal and I said this to him.) 

He was told that training was still going ahead just different day if doable. Whilst also being reminded by the coaches assistant that they did this voluntary. 
One of the coaches comes straight to practice from work and heads to work straight after games. 
After all was done he told them he was removing his kid from the team and wanted to complain. The coaches said this was fine if he felt the need to complain and gave him the number to complain to and then removed him from the group.

After two hours of being removed Trevor than messaged me. 
Telling me I was in the wrong for slamming his son saying he wasn’t good at all which was not what was said. 
I tried my best replying back diplomatically even saying what’s he’s accusing me of he did the same about the other boys slamming there ability implying his boy was the best, it didn’t work buttons were pushed and after some time of too and throwing I called him a hypocritical c*** and told him how he shouldn’t of messaged me if he didn’t like the responses he was getting. 

It gets a little awkward now as, our youngest kids go to the same day care as each other and after a while my wife made me apologise to him. If anything  for the kids. Although reluctant I did because I shouldn’t of called it him and kids shouldn’t be burden to two adults mistakes.

I still stand by my original comments but the name calling and apologised for that and told him what’s done is done and asked to be civil as our kids are friends at the end of the day. I may have said what I said but I made a mistake and willing to let bygones be bygones.

After the apology a few days later, I was approached by the coach with the complaint and notified Trevor had tried to get my boy kicked from the team. 
I’ve had to go through a process and was told to apologise. I told them I already had done before any of this and kept all messages to send forward in case they needed them. 

I was also told by the coach not to worry as Trevor has come out of no where with his complaint and the club haven’t taken it seriously as 24 hours before ranting and being rude to the coaches and parents of the team. He was actually praising them and sharing on social how he was happy his boy had made good friends and his coaches were amazing. They couldn’t understand what made him turn. 
After two more days I was approached again and Trevor had now gone to some other coach about the situation some one bigger in the club. 
I assume this was after not getting results he wanted.

I believe as do others, say it wouldn’t have got to  that point had Trevor not of contacted me privately 2 hours after being booted and everything was done. 
In my eyes he started to harass and gaslight me. To which wouldn’t of escalated in the first place had he of not got in touch with me in the first place and just left it.",,,,,,2,None,2
221,"AITA here? My grandma (my mom's mother) had an extensive jewelry collection. When she died she left most of it to my mom and my sisters. There were a couple of necklaces that look like they could be worn by either men or women and she left those to me and my brother. Right now my mom has the necklace she left to my brother because he's been away at university and then graduate school since grandma passed away.

He asked my mom for the necklace, to either get couriered to him or for him to pick it up next time he visits. He said the necklace is old and worn (true) but he wants to take the stones from it and put them in a ring to propose to his girlfriend. My mom told him anything from grandma's jewelry should stay in the family. I agree with this. I wouldn't give the stuff I inherited to my wife. It will go to my kids and if I end up not having kids to my nieces and nephews. This is also why most of the jewelry went to my sisters. My wife agrees with my mom and sisters that the jewelry should stay in the family. It's nothing to do with my brother's girlfriend. We met her and she's great. Everyone is thrilled he wants to propose. But my family loves my wife too and they would still say I should keep the jewelry in the family.

My brother doesn't agree and he's furious at our mom. He wouldn't listen when me and my sisters and even my wife and my dad told him mom is right. My brother says grandma left him the necklace, not mom and that grandma never said anything about keeping it in the family and also didn't stipulate that in her will. He wants the necklace and won't let it go no matter what anyone tells him.",,,,,,1,1,5
222,"I’m first generation, growing up my mom was the peace maker in her family. Everyone called her to vent, trauma dump and talk shit about the other person. She passed away 5 years ago this year. When she first passed away I would get calls from family, thinking “oh they’re checking in on us,” making sure we’re ok. The calls became weekly for over a year, all of my aunts on my moms side (my moms sister in laws) would call and vent, talk shit about about the other, tell me that they miss my mom. They’d call on Saturday nights when I’d be out with friends or on dates, as if I didn’t have a social life (i was 25 when my mom passed) 
So one day I stopped answering, my one aunt called 9 times in one week bc she thought something was wrong. (Not answering the phone was my only way I could think of to set this boundary) at the time I was going through my own things (I had my identity stolen and on top of that lost my job, the pandemic was starting to happen and I did not have the emotional capacity to be there for everyone else) I was having body numbing anxiety attacks and barley could get of bed. I clearly did not want to share this with my family bc they would just call one another and talk about it, I stayed to myself. Fast forward to now I’m in a better spot, have a great job. 

The calls have slowed down but now looking back how insensitive of them to dump all their negativity onto me when I was the one who lost my mom, but instead of me being the one everyone checked on it turned and I was checking on everyone. Thinking about it makes me sick and how much my mom took and how much an emotional toll it took on her and they passed that onto me. We are not as close anymore for many reasons. I will still call on holidays and bdays but I keep my distance for my peace. AITA for doing so? I’ve had my aunts say “since you don’t pick up the phone I don’t call that much” and make passive aggressive comments, I just ignore but the guilt does get to me from time to time. Does anyone else experience anything like this?",,,,,,1,3,2
223,"This might be a little long...I haven't even processed the passing of my grandfather emotionally as I've been too busy handling everyone else's emotions. 

My grandfather has just passed away 2 weeks ago. My brother is a well known pathological liar to me and my family. For the last 3 years I have been helping take care of my grandfather more in-depth as his health was deteriorating, and I wanted to support my mother as well as have my grandfather spend more time with the only female brought into the family since my mother, and is the last remaining female. 

My grandfather was an amazing man, and he loved my daughter more than anything. His only wish was more time with her but at 88 I can't say he didn't live a good life and that the two of them didn't make any core memories. With his passing meant I have had to be supportive to my mom even more than before and I have been taking a lot.of responsibility on y shoulders the last few years so she didn't have to bear the burden. This means I'm a witness and co-executor of his last will. 

I have warned my family for years all he does is look for handouts. He doesn't show up to offer help to any family and always comes running with his hands out trying to grasp whatever is being given away. My mother hasn't been in any state of mind to deal with the house, assets, spreading the wealth among those listed so I've been doing it. Slowly going through the home, packing everything up that's to be given away into labeled boxes for who they are for. My brother was left nothing in the will as he was never around and honestly is a massive POS. It is up to my discretion what he is to get. I want nothing from the house as I've never been someone who takes things. I would like more time with a man I considered a second father but we all know that's impossible. 

The house was left to me. As the drive is too far from my family I have decided to sell it and buy a home down the street from my parents. They have been vital in helping me take care of my daughter (single dad) who I have full time. My brother got wind of this somehow and has been throwing fits demanding he sees the will. I'm under no obligation to do so but I obliged and sent him a copy. I was met with more resistance and accusations that it's a fake and I'm stealing from him. He's been harassing my mother and throwing these outlandish stories about how ""Grandpa said XYZ was mine and I deserve it"" playing on my mother's emotions after just losing her father. 

My mother not being in the right mind has been letting him take whatever her wants saying ""well it sounds like he would have said that"" even though we have 30 pages of a will stating otherwise. My mother says she couldn't have done anything without me but she's trying to tell me to let my brother do what he wants as he is family after all. I know she's being like this because she just lost her father and I'm trying to be the rock holding everyone else up going through this. 

He tried to take things out of the house while I was at work and I caught him on camera. I went to his house and told him to give everything he took back to my mother as nothing has been dispersed yet through the family. He said he's going to sue me for executive rights over the will and I laughed and told him to go a head and try. He called my mother completely BSing his story at which I responded to the group text with the video of his laughing and emptying the garage. My family says I shouldn't have posted the video and now everyone's upset at me saying I'm singling out my brother and that if I'm being supportive of everyone, he needs to be included.",,,,,2,4,,3
224,"thowaway becuase reasons  


I (25F) was taking a bus home from work(about 30 min) and got into a conversation with a guy sitting a couple seats away from me. He seemed OK and the conversation felt natural so I really didn't mind. After a while he asked for my phone number, and while the guy was kinda cute, I'm really not looking for someone rn so I knew we're not gonna go out, but we both had at least 20 minutes on the bus, and I figuered rejecting him would make it really awkward. So I gave him my number and we continued chatting for a while, and when we got to our stop I told him I'm in a rush and took off.  


A few hours later he sent me a message asking if I want to grab a cup of coffee, and I said no. Next day I told this story to a friend and she said I was kind of a bitch for giving him my number when I had known I'm not interested, but personally I think both of us would be uncomfortable either way, and besides I don't owe the guy anything. He iniciated the convo going that way so I'm not resposible to make him feel good about it. I had a few shitty experiences with guys not reacting well to being told ""no"" and I really didn't want to go through that there.",,,,,3,2,,5
225,"I (22 F) and my boyfriend (23M) recently got into a big argument over me asking him to spend the rest of the day with me.

So on Friday night, my boyfriend came home and was telling me that this Saturday he and his friends have something planned and he’ll be gone the entire day. I said okay, and then a hour later he tells me that he’s actually going to go to his friend’s house tonight too. This normally would not be a big deal, but for the past two and a half months he has spent the entire weekend, Friday through Sunday, with his friends and would not come home at all until Sunday at like 1 a.m.

 We both work full-time jobs, so he leaves before I wake up, and I work later than him, so even though we live together, we kind of don’t spend a lot of time with each other M-Thurs, and on Sundays, we both have stuff to catch up on like laundry, work,etc. I told him this and asked if he could just spend the rest of the night with me since we haven’t really spent time with each other the last few weeks.

It then turned into a huge argument. He told me that I was being an asshole and trying to control him by not letting him see his friends. I told him that’s not true because he’s seen them every weekend for the past few weeks and all I want to do is spend one day together. He followed up by telling me that he’s a human and can do whatever he feels like, If I’m bored I can hang out with my sister or my friends. (That confused me because it’s not boredom; I just wanted to see my boyfriend.) I then explained again that I’m not telling him that he can’t see them. I just want to spend Friday together, but he would not let up or hear me out. He kept telling me that I was in the wrong for getting upset about him just wanting to go see his friends, that what I was doing was toxic, and that I was trying to manipulate him/the conversation by bringing up how many times he's seen them. I told him that I just wanted a compromise. I don’t feel like he has to choose between seeing me or his friends, but it would be nice if he could make time for both because at the moment he’s only making time for them. The argument just kept going like that until he left the house and didn’t come home again until Sunday evening. He’s still adamant that I was in the wrong and that I’m being stubborn by not seeing his side of things.

I just want to know if I’m truly in the wrong here. If I am, I will apologize, but I’m having a hard time seeing how I’m wrong. (And I’m very aware that this issue is super childish, but he was genuinely upset, like screaming at the top of his lungs.)",,,,,2,2,,2
226,"My (M23) ex boyfriend (M28) moved to London from South America in 2019. When we dated I saw that he rented a tiny shared room with 4 other people, it was horrific. So I asked my Mum if he could rent in my Grandma’s home for very cheap.

Unfortunately, my grandma died a year later and the house went up for sale. It was mid-covid and he was an unemployed student, so my Mum agreed to move him into my Aunts house as he would’ve been homeless, once again, for very cheap. The room could be listed at £1500 p/month as it’s huge and in central London, but he gets it for £450.

Since then, he graduated from college, left his minimum wage retail jobs and is working from home in the Tech industry. He’s on amazing money now but his rent only increased about £90 per month as my aunt is afraid to increase his rent (probably bc he’s my bf). To make things worse, he invited his best friend from his home country (who he lied told my aunt was his cousin) to rent in my Aunts. My aunt is old (75 years old) and doesn’t want to say no to be nice, so she agreed and his friend now rents there too. I asked him not to let his best friend rent there, but he didn’t listen and it went ahead.

I found out my boyfriend got a visa which allows him to work in the UK full-time, and he instantly broke up with me. I felt used. Like he used me and my family for accommodation until he got his visa and then broke up. He has no desire to leave my aunts as he’s using the money he saves renting there to invest in property in his home country.

Personally, I want him gone. I’m too young to deal with a 28-year-old ex renting with my aunt because he’s cheap and is investing in property. I’m finding it hard to move on. The day we broke up he downloaded tinder, who does that after a 4 year relationship? I feel like he’s used me and is continuing to use my aunt.

I told him I want him to move out of my aunts and finally be independent and rent his own apartment because he has the funds to do so, but he declined and said he won’t leave until he’s evicted. That makes things messy, my aunt isn’t a registered landlord. She’s just letting him live there for pennies because he was my boyfriend. What do I do?!",,,,,2,3,,None
227,"I (F) just gotten a job a few weeks ago at a local restaurant about 15 minutes from my house and it was the first job I’ve gotten in the last 2 years due to some medical issues. I applied and got the interview and then got the job. Been going through the training the last few weeks and never did anything wrong. I never bossed people around and never talked bad about anyone and was nice to customers and the other employees that I actually worked with. Well I was just at work today and was in a middle of a task when I was told by the manager that they needed to talk to me. At that point I knew that something wasn’t right. I was then told that multiple people reported that I was being bossy and that I was talking about other behind their backs. I was trying to explain to the manager that none of it was true and the manager called me a liar. I was fired so I handed in my uniform and I clocked out, grabbed my stuff and went home. On my way out the door I said “Now I see why you can’t keep employees” AITA for stating the truth about them not keeping employees due to the management lying about what people do when someone didn’t do anything wrong? Thankfully it’s somewhere I personally would never go to eat, but AITA?


Edit I did add exactly what happened. I also want to add that after I headed to my car to go home I broke down crying as I’m a very emotional person who has anxiety and depression. I don’t take kindly to people calling me a liar and won’t believe anything that I say when I try to tell the truth. It’s whatever I guess. I know people are still going to say that IATA even though I’m being honest and telling the truth. Also I meant to put the title as WIBTA for saying “Now I see why this place can’t keep employees”",,,,,2,2,,2
228,"I bought a house with my sister, which we both live in and rent out a 3rd room to our friend. My sister’s boyfriend’s tenancy is coming up and she wants him to move in for 3 months. After this they might go and travel but haven’t made any concrete plans (I think it will end up being longer than 3 months). My housemate and I get on with him fine but really don’t want him to move in for a few reasons:

1. I don’t think the house is big enough for 4 people. One bathroom and the kitchen is quite small
2. I don’t want to live with a couple. The house dynamic will change 
3. Our flatmate will probably move out as she’s also not happy for the reasons listed above. 

Although it’s my sister’s house too we moved in together without any talk of her boyfriend moving in. We agreed it was going to be us plus a lodger. 

I do understand her point of view and that she wants to help her boyfriend out/it would be nice for them to live together but I don’t think she gets how this will change the whole house dynamic.

Me: Okay...we all need to get together tonight and come up with a meal plan for now until the 21st (when both of our food stamps reload). And then before the 21st we need to come up with a meal plan  to make $1200 in food stamps last more than 2 weeks. I can't even fathom how this keeps happening every month. The $400 we get used to last the 5 of us almost 3 weeks, AND we were buying baby formula at the time. We need to figure this out because we can't afford this. My rent keeps being late because I have to use rent money to buy food that just keeps getting wasted anyway. I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just trying to fix this. We can not let this happen again.

230,"I went to the wedding of a uni friend, I met the Bride's brother and we have since been dating seriously nearly a year.

My friend seems 100% genuine but always wants to know everything about everyone and be in control. She always over exaggerates stories. Over the years there have been little examples of this but always brush it off.

One night out our friend group was drinking. My uni friend does not drink but the whole night was spiking my drink with more alcohol. Even after I declared I was just on the fizzy drinks she kept putting alcohol in when I wasn't looking. That night and next morning I was confused how I got so drunk but as you would.. I didn't think any more about it.

Two of the guys in the group separately without my prompt approached me saying what she had done, alcohol in my drinks. I spoke to her privately and said, ""hey fun night, but I didn't enjoy being that out of control so  no big deal but next time don't spike my drink past me saying no more"" just trying to not make it a big deal but wanting to trust going out drinking with the group again. Anyway, she denied the whole thing and spent the rest of this group trip gaslighting and discrediting me in any way. I thought this was such an over reaction as I genuinely asked in the nicest way not to spike my drink and in private so she didn't have to be embarrassed. If she had just said sorry we would laugh it off as an accident and fun night out.

From then she and her wife have been isolating me from the group and been attaking me with horrible messages and making stuff up about me to divide me from the group. 
I could just accept it and move on with my life wothout this group but 1) I don't feel I should have to be the one to put up with this and be treated like this, they are also my friends. And 2) I am going out with with one of the group who is also the wife's brother. So will always be tied to these people at family functions.

My bf sees the issue but says oh well just ignore it. How do I ignore that. On future meet ups they would refuse to give me the details like a meet up time knowing they could tell everyone else last minute as they all live close by but I am a 2 hour train ride away and have to book the train ticket the day before for the ticket to not be 3x the price. And when I asked everyone else in the group including my bf they would say.. I don't know the time ask them. It's enough to make you think you have gone crazy. My bf could definitely do a lot more be on my side but he has tried to bring it up with them but they shout a lot at him and threaten to talk bad about me to their mum.. What a threat? So from this he just says don't say anything to ruin the peace. How is that my problem. That is such a gaslight thing to do..isolate me then be annoyed at me when i have a problem with them being horrible to me.

My bf still hangs out in the group, in my eyes supporting their behaviour. 
I have lost a lot of time crying about all this so the fact he doesn't show me more support makes me more upset.

They are all telling me I'm over reacting and if I can't calm down then just leave the group. I have had to block most of them after so many horrible messages. And as good as split from the group.
But am I right to be upset when my bf for still hanging with them and wanting to go on holiday of a lifetime with them all. With these people who are happy to be that horrible. If it was just his sister at a family event I might understand but this..

Hi everyone,

I'm currently living with a roommate who loves to blast loud music at all hours of the day and night. It's been an ongoing issue for us, and I recently decided to confront them about it.

However, the situation quickly turned sour when they pointed out that I sometimes play loud music too. They accused me of being hypocritical and unfair for expecting them to stop while I don't always follow the same rule.

I understand their point, and I admit that I can be guilty of playing music loudly at times. But I feel like there's a difference between occasionally forgetting to turn down the volume and intentionally blasting music non-stop for hours on end.

I also pointed out that I'm usually receptive when they ask me to turn down the volume, whereas they always refuse to do the same for me. But they still insist that I'm being hypocritical and that we should both be held to the same standard.

So now I'm left wondering if I'm in the wrong here. AITA for telling my roommate to stop playing loud music even though I sometimes do the same?",,,,,1,2,,2
233,"I recently got engaged, my fiancee and I never wanted a big wedding but we love to travel. We've decided were going to get married at an all inclusive resort that throws the wedding in for free with a week long stay. We'd be paying for the trip 100% ourselves. We thought we'd do it with just us but then my siblings said they'd want to go to. My fiancee is an only child and her parents arent around any longer so she doesn't really have family but her best friends said they'd come in too.

My parents dont love our plan but said they'd come for a day if we absolutely insist on doing this. But they also want us to do a hometown reception for extended family that wouldnt be able to afford the trip. We dont really want to do that because I hate making trips back to my hometown, its a very backwards place in a lot of ways. Also it would be 50 people from my fam and nobody from my fiancee's and that would just feel awkward.

I got a call from my mom's sister saying im being an elitist jerk for doing this knowing most of my cousins wouldnt be able to make the trip. I did get invited to all the weddings of my cousins that got married in the last few years so the tradition is to invite everyone, I just dont really want to follow that tradition. Were not really close, I dont even have most of their addresses to send invites if I wanted to.

234,"My (F20) mam (F53) is an alcoholic, and about a year ago (after YEARS of me trying to make her acknowledge this) she finally got into AA. She told me she had stopped drinking about 3/4 months ago and I didn’t completely believe her but family told me it was true. I let her know how hurt I was by her drinking when I was a kid as it made her be mean to me and I don’t want to be around her when she’s drunk. It triggers my panic attacks, and I know that’s not her problem, but if she refuses to even try to stop drinking at least while I’m around (usually every 2-4 months) then I’m not coming to visit anymore.

On my most recent visit she has been acting like she’s not drinking at all. A couple of times I’ve caught her acting drunk and she insists I’m wrong and that she likes to have a laugh sometimes. 

I found two boxes of wine hidden under the sink when looking for a baking tray and asked my dad about them and he said he occasionally has a glass of wine. He’s not an alcoholic. 

Then the other night she was slurring and I asked her to stick out her tongue. It was black. I said have you been drinking and she said a firm no and again made fun of me. I checked under the sink and the two boxes of wine were down to half a box. I asked her and she admitted to having one glass that one night. I noticed she was drinking it out of a mug (how she has her tea) as opposed to in the wine glasses she usually drinks wine from. 

I spoke to my mam about this in a private moment and she apologized and said she knew it made me uncomfortable and promised not to do it again.

Last night me and my sister and her friends were going into town, which I’ve never done in this city before. I was nervous and expressed that if I needed her, would mam be able to pick me up. My sister then told me mam was drunk and wouldn’t be able to drive. I saw she was drinking out of a mug again, trying to hide it from me.

Today we had a talk and she told me she has a couple glasses every night. This means every time I asked if she was drinking when she was acting drunk she had lied to me and made me out to be overreacting and not being able to have fun. 

I honestly feel gaslit and betrayed. I have very poor mental health and struggle with my hold on reality so gaslighting is very serious and dangerous with me, more than most. Im not trying to control her but if it triggers me, I want to stay away from it, that’s just the healthy choice for me. I thought we told each other everything and to find out she’s been lying to my face, broken promises and gaslit me is honestly crushing. t’s summer and I was planning on visiting a lot and helping them do up my grandads old house for them to move into, but this really is a blow and I don’t feel entirely safe here anymore.

I asked both of them to please stop putting each other down in my presence. My brother said no problem, my sister said that she's done nothing wrong and my feelings don't matter. 

So AITA for hoping that my sister would support me while I'm in crisis?",,,,,None,2,,None
236,"I(30) live with my youngest sister (Violet11F), girlfriend (Evie30F), and my daughter (Vladimira11F). I have a majority of 75% custody of my daughter, her mother (Chelsea33) has the other 25%. I also have full custody of my sister, but that doesn't matter. Vladimira hates spending time with her annoying bio mother and has always seen my girlfriend as her mother.(In her own words) She even begs not to go at the end of every month as her mother forces her to be her family's personal maid. Makes her do too many chores and miss her tutor lessons. (Tutor lessons is the only time she gets to see violet besides school )And still expects her to act grateful after all the labour.

Long story short, they had a fight last week and vladimira shouted she can't wait to attend boarding school and never see her again. Chelsea yelled in her face that she never going and needs to forget about bit. Just to make this clear I promised to send my daughter to boarding school and the courts allowed it. This is when I told Chelsa that her daughter hates her and she's a shit excuse of a mother. Another fight started between Chelsa, Evie and I. It ended up Chelsa crying and accusing me of manipulating vladimira with money. ( Chelsea is no means starving but still suffering with the living crisis). But we only replied with her money issues are her own fault.

Honestly, this is year is the last year of primary school and her sats exams. ( for vladimira) I just want her to enjoy it and pass with flying colours. The only thing  preventing this is her bio mother stressing her out. AITA or not",,,,,2,4,,4
237,"My boyfriend (22) and myself (21) have been together for about a year. He moved in with me about five months ago. About six months ago we decided to set one specific day of the week to be our date day. Just to give us more one on one time. We both work full time and I’m going to college. The free time that we do have we usually spend with family/friends. Occasionally he “forgets” date night and has to be reminded that this is our only quality time together. Other than falling asleep together at the end of the night. So having that extra quality time does mean a lot to me. Which he has gotten better on not forgetting them or actually going through with them and understanding it’s part of my love language. 

We have been arguing a bit more lately and I’m leaving for a three week vacation in a couple of days. So I wanted to do something a little more special than just dinner and a movie. I decided to do a surprise date night (still on the scheduled day we both agreed on, surprise just meaning more than the usual) with a couple of things we could do together without the screens. 
So I called him and asked what time he would be home. He said soon and I started getting everything ready. After that I got about three more calls saying it was going to be later and later because he was helping his dad get ready for his sisters wedding later this year. I was not upset because I know these things need to get done and his dad can’t do them without his help. 

A couple hours pass and I get another phone call inviting me over there for dinner because his dad offered to get him food in return for helping him all day. At this point I told him everything I had planned and said I didn’t want to go over there. I asked him if he wouldn’t mind skipping the dinner either because I had done so much already, knowing his dad would understand. He decided to stay there and eat. I said nothing and waited for him to get home to tell him how I felt. 

I started telling him how I felt and he listened to the whole thing without any interruptions at the very end of it he stood up and walked away. I followed asking him if he would communicate what was on his mind. He said “you just think that you’re more important than my family and I shouldn’t spend time with or love anyone as much as you.” I was shocked. I had no idea what to say. I don’t think any of those things, but being that I am leaving in a couple of days and this was the last day to spend together I thought maybe I would come first. It ended up turning into a heated argument and him telling me I was being selfish and “you could’ve just enjoyed the last hour we had before I had to go to bed but instead you started an argument cause I spent time with my dad.”  I ended up crawling in bed and dropped the conversation. 
So my question is am I being selfish, am I overreacting, and am I being the asshole for dragging him away from family?",,,,,1,2,,5
238,"Hey!

I'm (28f) quite a homebody, and I really value the stability and cleanliness of my home. Because of this, I don't often make my home available for guests as I find they make me anxious, leave a mess, and disrupt my routine. 

My friend (32f) reached out to me a month ago saying she was taking a break from her relationship and needed somewhere to stay while she thought about continuing the relationship. Apparently she had gotten in a big fight with her partner,  and wanted a week to think things over with distance. Because this seemed serious I offered my space, even though I was going to be out of town at the time she requested. 

I cleaned my space, washed all the linens, got snacks and things to be a good host, rushed to get a spare set of keys so she could use them, made time in my schedule to drop them off to her, etc. 

I then left on my trip. I came back 5 days later to my house just as I left it. She ended up deciding to stay at someone else's place. 

She then had another argument with her boyfriend and asked me again if she could stay at my place. I said no, as I've already essentially hosted her. She said ""no you didn't, I didn't even go over to your place."" 

I said ""just because you decided not to come doesn't mean I didn't make my house hosting ready, and put in the time and work to be a host. I only do this every so often and I honestly don't want to do it again."" 

She said I was being ridiculous and that it's not like I had to do a lot. Still, it throws off my routine and my peace of mind in my own home. I spent my whole trip thinking about all the cleaning I'd have to do when I'd get home because she's kind of a messy person. I was relieved that she didn't actually use the place, but it didn't mean the mental weight wasnt there. 

So, am I the asshole for saying no?",,,,,3,2,,4
239,"Our best friend of 25 years is getting married. We are bridesmaids, and her two sisters are the Maids of Honor (MOHs).
The MOHs started organizing the Bachelorette weekend months ago. The guest list included the bridal party, and a bunch of the Bride's other girl friends. In total, there were 21 girls (I think) plus the Bride.

The Bride wanted a ""surprise cottage weekend"" and didn't know any of the details (e.g. location, activities) except for the dates in advance. She made it very clear that she did not want us to spend a ton of money on her. The Bachelorette weekend took place a couple weeks ago as a Friday-Sunday party in a large AirBnB chalet.

A few months ago, the MOHs asked us to etransfer $279 each for the weekend. We were also offered an optional spa day after checking out of the chalet, which we would have to pay for. No other discussion of expenses occurred. A bunch of us additionally bought and brought drinks, snacks, and supplies for games/activities (and we did not expect anyone to pay us back for those costs, of course).

After the Bachelorette weekend ended, the MOHs sent the entire group a bill, which outlined what everyone owed. We were shocked to find that around $300-400 was added for each guest.

We are some of the more financially stable members of the group, and are used to people trying to get us to pay for things we don't want... but we were appalled when we saw that all the other girls were given balances up to $760 that they never consented to in advance.

In our Bachelorette WhatsApp chat (the Bride is not in the chat, and doesn't know anything about this), we addressed how we were blindsided by the bill, as we never got the memo that we were expected to pay more than $279+spa services.

The MOHs offered to take a few expenses off of our individual bills, but our bills weren't even the issue really... the issue was the bills given to our other friends/the other girls (some of who we know aren't in a financial position to throw money around).

We think this whole thing is socially and financially irresponsible, and do not think that the girls should be paying the MOHs back for careless spending (e.g. adding expenses like $2000 for private chef, $1500 for bottle service, without first consulting the group or even informing them of the additional cost).

We paid the MOHs what we ""owed"" to avoid drama, and because we still love them as our best friend's little sisters. AWTA for calling them out in the group chat? We considered messaging the MOHs privately, but wanted the rest of the group to know how we feel, as we assume many of them feel the same way. We didn't want the girls to assume that everyone else was cool with the unexpected expenses, and grudgingly etransfer hundreds of dollars that they didn't agree to spend.",,,,,1,3,,3
240,"Many months ago, my mom (59F) suggested my husband &amp; I (31F) meet up with her &amp; my dad for a weekend getaway in the spring.  We both live in the same state, but they live 5 hours south of us, so get togethers are a little tricky sometimes.  We all moved to this state about 8 months ago after living very far from each other during the pandemic, at which time my husband &amp; i lived only 15 mins from his immediate family &amp; my parents were basically isolated. Now, we live close-ish to my parents and are on the opposite side of the country from his family. A big change. We agreed to the trip and she picked a weekend in May (many months away at the time) &amp;, once we'd all booked our rooms, noted how it was a happy accident the trip was scheduled for mothers day weekend.

Fast forward a few months &amp; I have had to travel or host visitors at least one week per month since our move and my husband has either done these things with me or watched our pets for us while I was away.  2 were for things relating to his family and the rest (at least 6 major events) were on my side - the majority of which dealing the fading health, eventual death, and memorial of my mom's father (my grandfather). He passed in January. My mom did not have a good relationship with him &amp; her feelings about losing him are complicated. 

Another thing to know is my mom's brother is getting married in June &amp; we (whole immediate family) are all planning to go. My mom's birthday (60th!) Is in July. For various reasons, my siblings &amp; I were planning a celebration for my mom during the wedding trip since that was the way that made the most sense for us to be together to celebrate  since we are all broke from all this travel &amp; also all have limited PTO, Except my parents who are retired and decently well-off

Now: After traveling with &amp; then hosting his parents for the past 2 weeks, my husband &amp; I are exhausted physically, emotionally, &amp; socially. The idea of this trip was too much. My parents called a few days ago to express their own concerns about the trip since the park we were planning to visit is still covered in snow &amp; the roads to get there require tire chains (which we don't have, but they just bought for themselves). My husband &amp; I decided not to go.

Well, us canceling this mother's day trip triggered a whole slew of terrible-ness &amp; now my mom feels like we care about everyone else more than her because ""she is NEVER the priority &amp; all these other family members get celebrated &amp; she gets forgotten."" She's extremely lonely in their new town; she's worried because women tend to die young in our family, so this birthday is a big deal to her; and (news to me yesterday) her best friend died a few weeks ago and she was hoping to have a heart to heart with me on the trip. She feels so unloved and I don't know what to do. It seems so uncaring to cancel on mothers day when she feels so bad, but we are also at our limit. AITA?",,,,,1,2,,4
241,"Before I start let me say that I know she’s her own person and can make her own decisions but I still care about her and want her to think through her actions

My ex gf (21f) has recently ended our 5 year relationship after her sister (24f) passed away. She was very emotional and ultimately decided that her and I (20m) needed to go out own ways and we broke up. It was messy and we’re both still hurting and heartbroken but she’s told me that she’s just kinda floating through life rn and just making decisions based on emotions instead of logic (she broke up with me because she felt it was right instead of because she thought it through)

While her sister was in the hospital we spent a lot of time with her brother and her sister’s boyfriend (25m), let’s call him Nate, because we were all grieving together. And eventually she started hanging out with her family without me because hanging around them was draining me mentally. Eventually her sister passed and she spent a few nights at her brothers and Nate’s places and when she came home she decided to end our relationship

 It’s been about 3 weeks since then and we both kinda hoped things would work out between us but recently she told me that while she was crying to Nate about me that he kissed her on the lips without asking. She kissed him back but they didn’t go any further and she told me the next day that she was confused but wanted to explore her options with Nate and see where things go. Obviously being told that crushed me and I felt disgusted that she would want a relationship with her dead sister’s boyfriend and I was angry at Nate for taking advantage of her while she was in such an emotional state. After trying to convince her of how gross this situation is and how she shouldn’t be doing it she still insists on seeing him and potentially starting a relationship with him. My main problem (other than not wanting her to move on yet) is that I don’t think he sees her as a real person she’s just a younger version of his dead girlfriend and he wants her back so bad he’s projecting his emotions onto her and also that he’s a known cheater and I don’t think he is going to change for my ex

I know I shouldn’t care and that it’s not my decision to make but hers but I still want what’s best for her but I just wanna know if what I’m doing is the right thing to do

TLDR: my ex is considering a relationship with her recently deceased sister’s boyfriend and I feel like that’s gross and don’t want that",,,,,3,1,,None
242,"This happened last week. My husband says I’m fine, a friend said I’m a jerk … 

I work in a cubicle farm next to several people, including Ronald (55? m). It’s a pretty quiet office as these things go, no one plays music out loud or yells when they talk on the phone, but there are about a hundred of us total so it’s not silent. We type on keyboards, open and shut drawers, talk to one another and to customers, walk around the building. Normal stuff.

Ronald is very easily annoyed by what I think is a normal level of noise. He has asked people to stop typing so loudly, complained that people’s chairs squeak too much, said that so-and-so should find quieter food to eat (we eat lunch at our desks), made someone turn down their small desk fan because it was too noisy for him, et cetera.

My job is very sedentary, and I have an issue where my legs become extremely painful if I keep them in one position too long, and I need to move them every thirty minutes or so. I usually move them on and off a pillow I keep under my desk for that purpose.

A few weeks ago I got covid, and since then my leg issue has been more painful (I’m talking to my doctor about it soon), so I bought a low stool to help elevate my legs even more and give me relief.

After I had used it for an hour or so, Ronald asked me what I was doing to make that “horrible banging noise”, and if I couldn’t stop it. I told him that I was sorry it made a noise but I have to move my legs or I’m in a lot of pain. He said it was far too loud for a shared workspace, and I said that it was a very normal and acceptable amount of noise. He called me a name and let it drop.

It’s a small wooden stepstool and it does make a little bit of noise when I move my legs on or off, but not very much. It’s like someone using a stapler or gently closing a drawer, and I only make the sound a couple of times an hour.

Am I the asshole for thinking that I can move my legs even if it annoys my coworker?",,,,,2,1,,3
243,"I (19F) am quiet close with my brother (18M) and we share the same group of friends. He's currently dating a dude (19M) that's almost 2 meters (6.5 feet I guess) and my brother is only around 1,7 meters (5.6 feet, assuming Google values are correct). So you can imagine they are one odd looking couple. 

So when we were all hanging out with our friends, one of them asked my brother if the height difference is ever a problem between him and his bf and he says that it's just a bit annoying that he has to tiptoe to kiss all the time. I see the opportunity for a lighthearted joke and say that I bet it's also annoying that he has to tiptoe all the time in order to give him a blow job. Me and most of our friends start laughing, but my brother's face quickly darkened and him and his bf immediately excused themselves and left despite our protests. 

I tried to talk with my brother afterwards, but he just shut down me and said he isn't in the mood for another one of my jokes. Tbh I didn't expect him to get that offended, he knows I have a bit of a humor and it's not the first time I made a lighthearted joke at his sake (or someone else's) and back then he laughed at them or at least didn't get offended. Idk if I should apologize or just wait for my brother to cool off and get over it. Either way, AITA ?",,,,,4,4,,4
244,"I see a lot of problems that need addressing but I try and pick my battles so I don't come off as bossy.

The main one is that they don't turn on the kitchen fan when they're cooking so I end up smelling their food all the way from my room (because of a small crevice in the doorframe that lets a lot of air in) especially when I'm sleeping. I often go into the kitchen and ask them to turn it on politely like ""hey do you mind just keeping the fan on while you cook, I just don't want the smell stinking up my room is all"", and they argue with me that it's loud and unnecessary.

And then it'll be other things like wiping the counter when they're done. I always find it greasy with bits of food lying around. They probably just forget and that's why I keep reminding them and now I'm being called bossy

Just yesterday, I went into the kitchen and saw one of them finished cooking but the smell was still lingering pretty strong. I turned the fan on full, and he turns it off as soon as I walk away. He says ""I'm already done cooking, why are you turning it on?""

I told him it's because the smell is still travelling around the house and he says ""alright, whatever you say, dictator""

AITA?",,,,,2,2,,2
245,"I have a friend I've known for a few years and it's fair to say we're pretty close. They're moving from their current apartment to a different one in a few months but there's a month gap where they won't have a place to live. Originally, they were going to stay with their sibling during that gap, but that fell through (I'm not sure why.)

They have not asked me personally, but they have posted on social media - basically asking for a temporary room/couch. 

Technically, we (my spouse and I) have the room to house them for the month. We have a guest room, guest bath, etc. They work full time, but we wouldn't need to ask for help with our rent, utilities, groceries, etc. Our home, in theory, would probably be the easiest place for them to be. 

A few weeks back, (before the moving stuff) while my friend and I were having some drinks, they asked if my spouse and I would ever have a threesome. I laughed it off and told them I think we're both happy sleeping only with each other. They kept pushing - kept asking why - asking who out of all my friends I would have a threesome with, if I had to. I was getting pretty uncomfortable at this point and did my best to shut down the conversation. They ended it basically saying they would sleep with both of us in a heartbeat. I had no idea they were attracted to my spouse, let alone ME, in a sexual way and it definitely altered the way I view our friendship. 

Also to add, if it's important, their view of monogamous relationships has been soured since their long time relationship ended and they are pretty vocal about wanting to try polyamory. 

Here's where I may be the AH. For this reason, I don't want to offer them our place to stay. My spouse works from home some days - I don't ever work from home- and Friend works rotating hours - meaning there would be times where they would be at the house alone. I fully trust my spouse - I know they'd never engage and would probably kick them out of our house if they even hinted at anything. And before this threesome conversation, I fully trusted my friend as well. I just don't even want to create a possible scenario where the topic could come up again. 

I'm not sure the best way to say no, even if they do ask me personally. Does it make me an AH to not even entertain the idea because my trust, while not broken, has been damaged because of a conversation over alcohol?",,,,,3,2,,1
246,"My fiancé (37M) and I (26F) have been together for over 6 years and engaged for 3 of those years. We are both neurodivergent so some of the things we do seem weird to others but seem to be typical for neurodivergent couples. 

We enjoy parallel play where we are in the same room but doing our own thing. And some times we get together and share activities together, usually one the couch watching something together. My fiancé almost all ways picks what we watch. Most of the time I don’t mind because we have a lot of the same interests like Star Wars, let’s plays, and anime. 

He gets super excited and starts over explaining everything like lore or facts about how the content was made and things like that. And I love that. I love seeing him excited and happy even if it’s something he’s already told me 1,000 times or something I already know.. and sometimes it’s things I’ve told him about ??. 

The problem is when I pick something… most of the time he will leave the couch and go back to his computer and we go back to being parallel. 

Last year I begged him to watch the twilight sage with me because I haven’t seen them since I was in middle school and I remember being obsessed with them and I knew they were going to be bad [I mean it is twilight] but it was something I thought would be fun and I wanted to do it with him… he refused and it caused an argument. He said I shouldn’t force him to watch something he has no interest in seeing and I told him that I sit through a lot of content that I’m not a fan of but I enjoy it cause he enjoys it. He says that’s my choice and I don’t have to do that… he’s right but it hurts that he doesn’t want to share the things that are important to me. 

Eventually he watched 3 1/2 of the twilight saga with me and I thought we had fun. We were making fun of the silliness and the acting together and we even played a drink game while we watch. 

Fast forward to today and I remembered a old cheesy childhood movie I use to watch all the time[one of the “Three Ninjas” movies] and I asked him if we could watch it together and he refused and said the same thing as before. He even brought up how I “forced” him to watch twilight. This time I just dropped it cause I didn’t want to repeat the same argument. 

Am I the asshole for wanting him to watch stupid cheesy things that I find interesting the same way I do for him?

EDIT: a lot of you guys think I tied him down and genuinely forced him to watch all of sage. He reluctantly sat down for the first one. He started to enjoy the bad silliness with me and HE suggested we watch the other parts. I was thankful after the first one and was ok with watching the rest on my own another time. He was the one who encouraged we watch the rest together and then we couldn’t make it past breaking dawn part 1.

I don’t want to force him to watch everything I watch. I want to be able to share special interests with him without him dismissing it entirely. 

Also if I hated star wars with out seeing anything about it (movie,shows,etc) how many of u would say I should give it a chance and watch one thing before completely dismissing it???",,,,,1,1,,2
247,"My SO and I have been in a long distance relationship for 3 years now. Everyday we call each other for about 6 hours.

Sometimes  we just feel like hanging out together and do our own thing. Often in  these times SO will watch a cutscene from the game we play and I will be  watching a youtube video in the meanwhile. They are aware that I do  this and perfectly OK with  it. Even while we are talking, SO often  plays Tetris on their computer. I am obviously fine with that, too, I  don't really care what they're doing as long as they're with me.

Today  I asked for their opinion about something in our game that I forgot  they wouldn't know about yet. They realised that I had spoiled them, and  I felt terrible about it. I should've been more careful.

It  upset them greatly. They became quiet, I learned that prodding them,  trying to keep up the conversation or moving on to other things upsets  them further, so I just keep my mouth shut and wait until they want to  speak again.

While we sat in  silence, we were waiting in queue for a duty in the game, so I just sat  here twiddling my thumbs until I decided to watch some youtube. After a  few minutes SO asks me if I said anything. I say ""no,  why?"" and they  explain that they heard a noise. I said it might be that  my mic picked  up some sound from the video I was watching. They got more upset with  me, saying I shouldn't be watching videos while on call  with them  because it's rude. In the moment I just apologised, and we did a  dungeon.

Afterwards, I told SO I  was quite upset with them for scolding me about watching a video, since  we were sitting in silence anyway, and I thought it was pretty  ridiculous that they dictate what I can and cannot do when it doesn't  change the fact that I am quiet on the call. They said that they weren't  busy with anything else, just sitting there, and they expected me to be  sitting there with them. They said if I wanted to watch a video I  should have told them at least. I was pretty insulted that I have to  announce what I am doing to them because it doesn't affect them either  way, and they're often doing other things, too.

They  said it makes them feel like I'm not really there, that I'm not paying  attention to them. I  said that was nonsense, because they wouldn't have  even known I was watching a video, and when they did speak to me I   paused it and responded to them. I believe it is quite stupid to expect  me to quietly sit with them, but they believe it is terrible that I  can't see how rude it is that I watched a video while they were feeling  down. We didn't come to any kind of agreement here, and SO got angry and  left the call.

I would appreciate some outsiders perspective here. AITA?",,,,,2,2,,4
248,"I (26F) went to the hospital for stroke-like symptoms 2 months ago. I ended up being admitted for 3 days and didn’t hear anything from my 2 brothers (17 and 18) during my entire hospital stay. I spent my hospital stay depressed because of that. By the time they reached out to me, I was already discharged. 

At first, I was just happy they reached out at all. But as I thought about it more, I began to feel hurt that they couldn’t even take 2 seconds to send me a text during those days I was hospitalized. I live across the country and we don’t really talk much on a day to day, but I feel like reaching out to an immediate family member in a timely manner after an emergency is the bare minimum. Come to think of it, they haven’t reached out to me after other medical procedures I’ve had either, even after I told them the date. 

I haven’t brought this up to them yet because I tend to bottle up my feelings (I’m working on that). Plus there is a long history of my family (my mother in particular) invalidating me any time I confront my brothers about anything, which has led them to lack a sense of accountability. In fact, it’s a major reason I moved out. 

Either way, it’s eating away at me and I’m not sure I’ll be able to let this go. I’m thinking of confronting them, and if they don’t apologize or they get snippy, I won’t go. 

Besides, it would be a stretch financially. I have a ton of medical debt and also need to save as much as I can because I work a toxic job and am looking to quit soon. Also, I could have another medical procedure on the horizon that may conflict with the graduation (I find out later today). For now, I’ve already booked the plane ticket and told my mother I would go. But I paid a little extra so I could get a refund if needed. 

So all things considered, would I be the asshole if I didn’t go to my brother’s graduation?",,,,,1,1,,None
249,"A few days ago I hit a car while reversing on a parking lot. It was only a very small push with my towbar, so only a bit of the plastic encasing of the license plate broke off, and the license plate itself tilted forwards a bit. 
Naturally, I left a note stating my phone number and my name, and put it behind the windscreen wiper. My intention was to pay for the damage done. 

However, the owner of the car called just today, asking me if I took the license plate. I told her I didn't, and it turned out she didn't notice the note (1/3 of A4) and drove of, losing her license plate along the way most likely (or someone stole it). I sent photos of the original damage to the owner.

As of now, I am very much in doubt what I should reimburse.

She has been living off me though Because she doesn't have a job and blames it on her phone being hacked but we have a computer that she can receive emails with, I have even filled out applications with her but she says that she doesn't want to work at any 12 dollar a hour job even though the only bill she has to pay right now is her phone bill I pay my own.                                                                                                                                                       One day I looked online and seen a video about couch flipping and that's what I have been using for us to eat but today. She constantly barrage's about how she made over 1,400 dollars a week when we lived in North Carolina she has only had 3 jobs since we have got back in 2021 and they have only lasted for around 2 months and then she quits.
                                                                            This summer I have been saving up to go to NAYC and she has only pitched in 100 out of the 700$ that I need but l'm not even mad about that even though 200$ out of that is for her spending money on the trip. It's just that she doesn't try at all. Yes she helps me move the couches but still why can't she just get a job and we live like a normal person.    .       .                                                         .                                                                Another thing is one day we are riding in the car and at that time I had all the money to pay cost is 450$ put we need 400$ of spending money for me and her each so I didn't give it yet because I was still trying to get the rest but she didn't listen to me fully and told everyone that I was already paid for when there was people who were going to fund me some money and she starts yelling at me about this for 2 days till finally I just sent them 170$ out of the money I was going to use to but more couches.                               .                             she finally sent me over the edge. Today after She ran off with some dude for no reason when I had plans for selling and buying more couches today and already had a buyer for one. So after she got back home I cussed her out and told her how she dosent know how to be an adult and she acts like a little kid and she needs to handle her responsibilities like an adult. She said that I just need to go move in with my dad but he is abusive and drinks all the time and is worse than her sometimes. I fee bad and I don’t know if I AM THE ASSHOLE",,,,,4,4,,1
252,"
I (19f) am a full time college student living with my mom (56f) and my dad (62m). Around this time last year, my maternal aunt passed and was followed a few days later with my maternal grandfather. His death was sudden, so my mom had to do a lot of legality stuff. Including in this legality, my mom became my maternal grandmothers power of attorney since she has dementia.

Fast forward to a month ago, my grandmother was hospitalized and diagnosed with vascular dementia. It was decided to proceed with a DNR and go the hospice route. My mom and I have been going over to my grandparents house from 8am-8pm every day (when I don’t have class, I’ll still go to my grandparents after class which is an hour away) and spend as much time as possible acting as a hospice nurse since our state doesn’t provide 24/7 care. I have been over there full time trying to help take care of my grandmother and support my mom while prepping for finals. My mom left my dad some of the responsibilities of our house since I can go over and pick up the weekly chores.

My dad has always been a bit lazy - he works part time since he has his a barbering business but he only cooks and does dishes while my mom is the breadwinner working full time and doing the rest of the chores when I don’t - and all that she really wanted him to do was the cat litter and give our asthmatic cat her medicine before she has an attack. The medicine is meant to be a preventative since it’s so hard to get her out of an attack once it happened. 

When I got home to do the rest of the chores, the cat litter box was full (one of the cats doing their business outside of it, it was that full) and the asthmatic cat was in a full blown attack. He gave her medicine during that time, but hours later she still wasn’t doing okay so I told him to give her more. My dad started to complain about it since “she already had her medicine earlier and was fine” and I tried to explain how it’s preventative and made an analogy to how you put oil in a car (ngl I was annoyed so my tone was kinda harsh) and he just blew up on me, telling me “I’m your father, I deserve to be treated with respect, so don’t speak to me in that tone” and just started to yell. I just went upstairs and sat in my room until he eventually went to bed, and then I packed up my stuff and went back to my grandparents.

This morning he came to mow the lawn at my grandparents, and my mom tried to speak to him about it since I told her this stuff last night. He only told her that I “disrespected him” and refuses to elaborate. I’m in class now and I still have to go back to our house and do the rest of the chores (including the ones my mom gave my dad to do since she doesn’t trust him to do it) and I was wondering if I should apologize. I don’t really know if I should, since I don’t feel like I was in the wrong, AITA though?",,,,,2,1,,1
253,"My dad has struggled with his health and addiction issues since I can remember. It got even worse in 2020 when my dad was diagnosed with dementia. It was heartbreaking to see him like that. I did not cope well through this. My mother gave me 2 family heirlooms from my dad's side during this time. I put them on display in my apartment and have had them up ever since. It meant so much to me.

My dad passed away this year. It has been the hardest time of my life. I feel as though I have been losing him for so long. I did not cope well with the news and shut down. My dad had always wanted his body donated to science but apparently, he did not meet the qualifications and my brother decided to have him cremated. My brother didn't tell me this, my mom ended up telling me. She said him and one of my father's friends planned to spread his ashes near his friend's house on the ocean. His friend's house is far away. I asked my brother if I could have some of my dad's ashes because I would like to have them nearby. My brother said he would think about it.

My mother ended up getting some of the ashes from him and giving them to me. My brother has been taking all the photos of my dad and heirlooms left at my mother's house. I am okay with him having these things. 

Today my mother called me and said I have to give her the 2 heirlooms she gave me in 2020 back. She said my brother has told her they are his and my dad gave them to him. The thought of taking these things down and driving them to my mom's house breaks my heart. I understand my brother is grieving too but it feels like I'm having to fight to keep anything from my dad.

254,"Still high-school students here, so you'll obviously see lots of immaturity.

My friend, let's call him Mohammed, decided to run away from home. He gave us his reason, it was because he got into an argument with his parents because he got caught vaping and smoking weed for the 7th time. He lost access to all of his electronics so naturally he was upset, and decided to go to run away from home. When he came to school, he told us he was kicked out of his house, but by the end of the day he clarified he was exaggerating and just didn't want to go home. My friend, who I'll call Evan, decided to drive Mohammed home to his house, and then take him into town. I got home and around 30 minutes later I get a call from Mohammed's phone. His mother is on the other end literally crying saying she can't find her son. She's worried sick so I give her Evan's number and tell her he was last with Evan and went out into town with him.

I do not know what Evan told this woman but all I know is he said something along the lines of ""Mohammed isn't with me but he's somewhere safe with a few friends"" which was a lie. I go to the gum 1.5 hours later and get a text from Mohammed's mom. She's still looking for him. I figured Evan would have told the truth so I was confused. I texted her back saying that I'd help her in any way I can but I had no idea where he was since Evan left with him and told her Evan would know for sure. She then told me what Evan said and I told her I couldn't help in that case but could ask some friends. I get home frome the gym and Evan calls me, explains he lied, I lose my shit at him and Mohammed and tell them they're being incredibly stupid and they need to come clean ***right now***. Mohammed, high again, mumbles something and Evan goes ""bro Mohammed knows what's best for him"". They roll into my driveway and Evan goes ""oh btw Chris I'm at your house, can you give me the tent so Mohammed can sleep in it."" 10:30pm, around 2°C, and Mohammed is going to sleep in a tent.

Evan calls his girlfriend as a last effort and she kept saying no, Mohammed can not stay here, until Evan puts her on the spot and puts her on speaker and says Mohammed is in the car too and she finally relents and says yes. After this I got pissed so I called them morons, told them goodnight, and went inside. I immediately texted Mohammed's mother and said I knew where he is and gave her the address he was staying at, as well as my address just incase. Mohammed's aunt calls me and asks me a few questions which I happily answer and she thanks me and says goodbye. Mohammed's mother picked him up and she texts me profusely thanking me. Igo to school today and I keep hearing about how I ""snitched in Mohammed bro"" to which I responded that my decision if Mohammed didn't want that to happen, he could quit smoking weed and not away from home and getting high and lying to his family.

So... am I the asshole??",,,,,3,2,,2
255,"I (25F) feel a bit down - I always do whatever my friend (24F) wants to do, even if I’m not a fan. Because I like to take interest and learn what my friend likes and dislikes. 

Anyway, me and my friend are going back to a country I grew up in. It’s her first time going, and I’m very excited to show her where I grew up.

She gave me a list of places she wants to go, and tbh I don’t really want to go there, and she can do all this by herself. But she wants me to come and asked if I would. I decided I will go with her, because it’s what she wants to do and she’s my friend.

I also want to do something that I like too, and I asked if she wants to come join as well. 

She said she doesn’t.

It upsets me a bit, because I do everything she wants to do. But she never interested in what I want to do.

256,"I want to be as anonymous as possible, so I will not be saying genders or ages, we are all in our 20s.To start off, I’m oblivious and simple. This is the main reason I’m making this post because I don't know if I’m in the wrong.

Mill and Harley (fake names) are 2 friends of mine. Both of them are of a similar race. For anonymity, I'm going to refer to races as types of birds. Both Mill and Harley are ""partially"" *Eagle*, not ""fully"" *Eagle* (this is important later).

I like to goof off (which has caused issues due to my obliviousness, my friends have confronted me about it before and I'm super appreciative of it). With that being said, my friends are also goofy. Some of us (me included) have a dark, self-deprecating sense of humor, Harley being the darkest.

We have a group chat with other friends. One day, a friend posted a flier about an *Eagle* Festival. Harley replied with something along the lines of ""The festival of my people"" and Mill just went OFF on them in the group chat. Saying things like ""Um, you're only like 1/4 *Eagle* so stfu"" (Paraphrasing, not exact message. Tried to go back to find the messages, but I guess my phone's text memory doesn't go that far back.) Harley wasn't too phased by Mill's comments. They didn't get mean, angry, or apologetic, but were being silly about it instead (I think to try to lighten the mood back up or maybe they didn't know Mill was seriously upset). I texted Mill privately to ask if they were serious, they were. For our chat, I do have exact texts since our chat doesn’t go too far back, so I want to use exact words (personal details replaced).

OP: Not gonna lie, you sounded a bit hostile in the chat

Mills: Bc they’re trying so hard to hang on to that ¼ *Eagle* which they don’t even celebrate. I’ve heard them make hella racist *Eagle* jokes (keep in mind we’ve only interacted like 5 times) and tbh coming from someone who’s more *Hawk* than *Eagle* is really offensive. Bc I dealt with that shit my whole life even adulthood. They may come off as mixed but they have no right to be making those types of jokes bc I doubt they’ve experienced the same things I have.

This is where my AITA judgment comes in. I interpret their message as “They don’t look *Eagle* enough, but I do, so I’m allowed to celebrate it and they’re not” which feels pretty racist to me, but I could be wrong. The thing is, Mill isn’t even “100% *Eagle*” either, but does “look” more *Eagle* than Harley. Now, for the racist jokes, I have no memory of them. I don’t think Mill ever hung out with Harley without me being there too. Something about Mill is they’re a tad touchy when it comes to *Eagle* related things. Now I see Mill differently. I’ve admittedly been a little distant with Mill and I think they’ve noticed because they get upset with me a lot more easily now. Am I and Harley wrong and is Mill right? AITA?

TL;DR: I think my friend is wrong, but I’m not sure?",,,,,None,3,,3
257,"Ok, so a little bit of background. My mom and dad were young when they got married, and my father was a very conflicted and messed up individual. He was extremely abusive to my mom, and she got out of the relationship when I was about two years old. My mother gained full custody of me, but I was required to have visitation with him after they were divorced. He picked me up about 50% of the time, and the other times I was desperately hoping he would come. The lies and excuses kept mounting and mounting.

He had two other children, my half brothers, who are four and six years younger than me, (26f). 

When I was about 11 years old, my mom and I moved to NC. Dad agreed to come visit me, and I would occasionally talk with him on the phone. He visited me a grand total of 1 time. After a lot of deliberation, I decided to tell him I no longer wanted contact with him. I told him I was sick of the lies and excuses. He respected my request, and as a result I no longer had a lot of contact with his side of the family. I have talked here and there with my brothers, but barely any contact. I also cut off contact with my grandmother on that side, as she was pressuring me to reconcile with him. Fast forward fifteen years, and about 4 days ago I found out that my father passes away. Due to all of the past trauma and abuse from him--emotional--I am torn between reconnecting with his family and going to a celebration of life in  a couple weeks. I love my mother, but she is convinced it would only hurt me more if I went, but I do think it would help with some sort of closure. 

AITA if I do not go?",,,,,1,1,,1
258,"background: my brother and my counsin have the same birthday and want to celebrate it together

now onto the story

my brother has had an ""argument"" with our friends who were invited to their birthday party. reason is unclear to me but cause brother argued with them for not going to our house when not invited and then he starts to make it even worse by threatening them. afterwards he complains to me for them not being friendly and ignoring them while calling them selfish narcassicting b\*tches.

then yesterday i went to one of our friends who has an arguement with my brother. i've know that friend for 5 years now ans the only time i was angry at him was because my brother went too bug us with what ever we went to do.

so after i hearded both stories i sided with my friend cause i know him for a while and also know my brother lies alot not i got backlash in the group app from the birthday due to me not wanting to go because 4 people who i sided we kicked out of the group by my brother

so my question is am i the asshole for siding with my friend and not wanting to go to the birthday anymore even tho its also the birthday of my cousin",,,,,4,2,,4
259,"Context: I joined the class about a month late. There was a mess up with scheduling. I got completely caught up within 2.5-3 weeks, so I was on equal footing with the rest of the class. We had our final the 2nd week of April. The TAs started grading everything( papers and exams) soon after. For some reason, everyone else's work has been graded but mine. Classes end Friday and I'm a bit frustrated at this point. I need the class to graduate. I've tried contacting the TAs to see what the holdup is, but they don't answer.  I've tried emailing the professor who also seems to not answer emails or be in his office.

Today, it was really, really sunny &amp; hot, and my best friend had to submit a printout of a fee receipt pdf. Because if he didn’t submit it today, he would have to pay extra fine the coming day and the fine was hefty. 

He asked me to submit that doc on his behalf at the college, but I declined his request, since it was really hot outside, and I was resting, and didn’t want to go out. He requested me 2 more times, but I still declined. He then proceeded to yell at me on the phone.

261,"I'm in my early twenties and I'm living at home with my parents while simultaneously going to uni and working from home. Both parents are working full time. 

Recently got into an argument with them over me telling them that I can't do all of the chores because I don't have enough time for that. Here's an example of how they imagine my day should go: I wake up early and go to classes, after, I return home and do all of the cleaning that needs to be done while somehow working at the same time. This seems ridiculous especially since I never leave my room unless I need to eat/take a shower. They litter the house, yet expect me to do everything because ""I'm home"". I don't think it's fair to expect one person to clean everyone's mess because they work from home.

It all started because I told one of them that we're running low on milk and asked (since I knew they were going to go get groceries that day) if they could get some. Suddenly I get told how I'm the one who's going to do that and no matter how much I explained that I'm working that day and I can't leave my pc they wouldn't listen. It's really frustrating since I work on weekends as well and it doesn't seem unreasonable to ask them to do the groceries when they are home watching tv and I'm working. AITA?",,,,,1,2,,2
262,"Im going to try and make this a short question.

I have struggled with substance issues pver the years. Mostly smoking and drinking (nothing hardcore link heroin etc). Struggled really bad with depression and the like for at least the past 5+years.
I met my current partner over 2 years ago, and since then I have stopped doing anything, apart from the odd drink at the weekend after a week of work.

I haven't spoken to my 2 sisters in well over a year as both their partners smoke and stuff. This was where I'd go most nights and we would be just chatting, drinking and all that. I'd then go home and do the same.
Pretty s*** time of it really.

So anyway, I cut all that out my life to avoid the temptation. I'm now not doing any of that and have a better life for it. New job, have a better home, better job etc etc 

Now, I have after all this agreed to go for a meal with one of my sisters and father and explain why I've gone this route and how it has helped me. I just want to clear the air so to speak.

My partners reaction to me agreeing to this meal is that she is leaving - doesn't want any of that in her life and is looking at places to move to. Ignoring me and saying that we have nothing to talk about. She says she doesn't trust me to not ""do it"".

263,"I (F.17) have been together with my boyfriend (M.19) for 2 years and 2 months. We are in a long-distance relationship and I visit him about every other weekend, and sometimes he visits me too. However, when we had been together for about 9 months, there was a big fight between the two of them. I was at his place and was supposed to go back home that day, but my planned train was cancelled. I called my mom to let her know that I would be arriving an hour later than planned. She yelled at me very loudly, asking why I hadn't known about it earlier and why I was telling her only 1.30 houres before my original departure time, since she was already waiting for me. I started crying and after she hung up, I called my grandparents hoping they could help me. Unfortunately, my mom was with my grandparents and took the phone away from my grandma to continue yelling at me for seeking help. I cried even harder and my boyfriend took my phone away to explain the situation to my mom since I wasn't able to. Instead, she yelled at him to stay out of it. I can't say what the conversation was about because I left the room to calm down. I only heard yelling but didn't listen. And then... the drama began. I took the earliest train I could get and my boyfriend reassured me because I didn't want to go home. When I got home, my mom yelled at me that my boyfriend shouldn't talk to her like that and that I couldn't see him for the next 2 months. He's also not allowed to come to our home anymore, even to this day. Unfortunately, the two of them still haven't made up because they both think they're in the right, and it hurts me that they're estranged. I would like to have him over again. I'm on his side because I know he was only trying to protect me and he would have stayed calm and rational if my mom hadn't started yelling. The argument hasn't been resolved for over a year, and both are stubborn. My boyfriend feels guilty about everything that happened and is now even afraid of my mother. He's very sorry about everything and would like to clear things up, but he doesn't want to apologize to my mother unless she apologizes to him for yelling. And my mother thinks she's completely right and very resentful. She's a very controlling and opinionated person and doesn't see any faults. The rest of my family thinks it's wrong that I'm on my boyfriend's side because blood is thicker than water, but I'm on his side. The argument from back then still weighs on me sometimes, but fortunately not on our relationship. I'm moving out in 3-4 months, so the argument from back then won't matter anymore, but I need to clarify whether I'm in the wrong for siding with my boyfriend. PS: For a while, I wasn't even allowed to talk about my boyfriend because my mother had so much hate for him. She's calmed down now, but she still doesn't want to see him. She even wants to forbid me from inviting him to my birthday because she would have to see him. But I won't let her ruin my 18th birthday.",,,,,2,4,,2
264," Let me begin my first saying I (33f) cause a lot of issues with my sister (35f) because I am a terrible communicator. I am awful at saying no and setting boundaries so my sister is used to telling me what to do and I do it as to avoid any issues. I now have a 3 year old son. I work 60 hour weeks as a CPA so I only see my child 2 hours a day on weekdays and then on weekends. I feel really bad for him because both my mom and my MIL were SAHMs. When my sister had her first child she was a SAHM, but now she works part time. Also to set the stage, I have babysat her 2 children about 4 times a year for the last 7 years including multiple overnights, but she has watch my child one time for 2 hours. When I do an overnight cousin spend the night I buy them dinner, plan an activity, take them to the park, and get them matching pajamas, have pancakes for breakfast. Also when my sister couldn't go on spring break with her kids this year because it was her 10-year wedding anniversary so she sent her kids and a nanny to join us on our vacation, which was fun, but because the nanny only worked certain hours, I had to watch all 3 kids until my sister and BIL joined us. Also I have gone to my niece and nephew's class Easter parties and other school events. My sister has said my child is too wild and whiny for her to babysit and has never really tried to have a relationship with him. She tells him that he must hate her because he won't kiss or hug her, but really he is just uncomfortable around her because she has never been kind or loving to him. She has told him that he is whinny and manipulative. Last year my sister asked us to attend her daughter (4f) dance recital. We drove 1 hour round trip to sit in the hot sun in Texas summer. We were not told it was outside so my 2 year old (age at the time) had to sit outside for an hour without sunscreen. No one said thankyou for coming, so I decided it was not that important that we came. This year we got invited through a group text and  my son already had a playdate scheduled at that time so I did not reschedule since it was not a big deal that we came last year. My sister called me and yelled at me that I am a terrible aunt that what I did was wrong. When I told her I thought my toddler son would have a temper tantrum and be whinny which she hates during the dance, she told me to leave him at home with his Dad. Again I barely see my son and husband already and I did not want to leave them. She said I could have left him for a couple hours to see my niece, but she has never tried to have a relationship with my son so I don't know why I would sacrifice my precious time with my son when my son will never get the same in the relationship with his aunt in the future. The issue above is small, but there have been a million of these situations and I am tired of my son's time being sacrificed with nothing from his aunt in return. AITA?",,,,,2,1,,1

I am going to start this with no I am not getting a divorce you ppl on Reddit love to suggest that.

my husband is a soldier, I am pregnant and I stay at home taking care of the house. I do all the house work except for dishes, litter and trash. I have back problems that the pregnancy is making worse, so I can’t stand for long and my feet also get super red and puffy and numb if I stand in one spot for more than 15 minutes. I can’t clean the litter box (my OB directly told my husband to start doing it) and we usually take turns taking out the trash but on deep clean days it’s a lot and heavy so he does it. 

My husband likes to put off his chores until the last minute. He gets home, sometimes he eats the food I make with me sometimes he takes it to our room and eats while playing video games often than not it’s video games. I ask him to wash the dishes he says he will later. They sit there for days me asking for it to be done. I eventually have to wash them so I can cook, which takes all day because I can’t stand for long. I point this out to him he says he does them Saturday. But that’s disgusting bc most of the time he just puts his dish in the sink with food on it still. 

The litter box is awful. My poor cat shouldn’t have to deal with stepping in their own shut to go potty. I tell him he needs to clean out the litter box, same fucking thing. I don’t know how often he actually does it but if it’s only when I ask him to it’s once every 2-3 weeks and at that time it’s a mountain.

He also leaves food on his side of them room and all kinds of trash. It’s disgusting. His side of the room I don’t touch because then he can never find anything. But then it gets so messy in his side it goes to mine. 

He plays videogames until 12-3 in the morning. All his friends are single men that are unemployed so he stays in with them all night. I wake him up in the morning because I drive him. I have to yell at him to wake up and sometimes have to throw a pillow at him.

My suggestion ti him after I gave up on having to beg was to get him a chore chart and stickers. Put his chores and brushing teeth and shower on it and he has to put a sticker when he completes them and then he can play. He said I was treating him like a child. He is acting like a child. Besides this he is a good husband. I’m just so tired. And his friends yell loud enough Everytime I ask him something I can hear them say “women belong in the kitchen” and all other shit. 

When he does his chores and spend time with me he is wonderful. But he plays videogames constantly and it is taking over our life. We had sex maybe once in the last month bc of this. I don’t know what else to do. But I don’t want him ti feel bad and feel like I am mothering him. I am his wife, but he is the money maker so maybe I should just give up and do it all.

The care company (I hope you understand what I'm talking about, idk what its called in english) seems to mean that we need more than four people to work and my mom asked me and my boyfriend if we could because she doesnt want randoms in the house because that stresses out the boys. She said that we don't even need to work. We would be getting salary without working.

I'm not sure if accepting that offer would be a good idea even though we are struggling with money. But I really dont want to put my family in a situation that is bad for my brothers.",,,,,1,1,1,
267,"AITA for getting upset at my boyfriend's sister for taking his clothes?

I (20 F) have been with my boyfriend (22 M) for 2 years now and therefore know his family really well. I get along with them and we have formed a close bond together and I really enjoy spending time with them as well as with my family.

Since we are so close, it is quite common for us to share or gift things, and I personally do not have a problem with it. I am glad that they accept me as their family, however, recently I've noticed that my boyfriend's sister (18 F) has been wearing his clothes quite a lot.

Now, one in all this isn't an issue. I think it's normal for siblings to share stuff like clothes. The issue is that all the clothes she takes from him are things that I gifted him. Matching shirts, hoodies or sweatpants - ever since we've been together she keeps taking the things I got for us. 

It's fine if she likes the same things and I wouldn't mind lending things to her if she actually returned them.

I've noticed this when my boyfriend wouldn't wear what I got him anymore. At first I thought it was because he didn't like them a lot or maybe due to sentimental reasons, but he later told me they're constantly in the laundry and then his sister takes them. He tried talking to her about it but she just said that ""it's not a big deal"". 

When I visited them recently, I noticed that she was wearing a pair of cartoon sweatpants that I bought for both me and my boyfriend. When I asked my boyfriend why she has them, he just shrugged and told me that he didn't even know she had them. He did seem genuinely upset about it, but I also know he could never raise his voice at his sister. As I already mentioned before, he already tried to talk to her about it but she keeps shrugging it off.

Now, about a week ago I completely lost it. I was scrolling through my Instagram and came across a post from his sisters account. It was a picture of her and her friend at a party and her friend was wearing MY hoodie that I forgot at my boyfriend's place. If it was her wearing it I might've been fine with it but this was a complete stranger who was wearing my hoodie, which was also very expensive as it was merch from an artist I really like.

A few days ago, I decided to ask his sister if she could give him the hoodie so he can give it to me when he visits and she told me she doesn't have it and neither does her friend. I do admit it might be a little petty but I lashed out at her for being irresponsible with other people's belongings. She did lose some of the clothes I gifted my boyfriend before but this just threw me over the edge.

I know they're just clothes but I paid for them. I spent money that I barely even have to thank my boyfriend for everything he does for me. I know I am not obligated to but giving other people gifts is my love language and I am happy doing it. 

Am I the asshole for lashing out at her and being upset ?

EDIT: Sorry I didn't clarify but she didn't know that the hoodie she lost was mine. She took it thinking it was his.",,,,,2,1,1,

269,"throw away as my family uses reddit.

My (41M) Dad's (M64) birthday is coming up and I had decided I wasn't going to call him for his birthday.

The backstory:

My Dad and younger brother (who lives with him) have consistently failed to call me for my birthday for... as long as I can remember at this point.  They will typically remember a day or two after, and give me a call (my brother just piggybacking from my dad's calls, he doesn't even take the phone, he just yells ""happy bday"" from across the room)

Last year they both forgot (again) , and a few days later came by  to ""gift"" me some Grocery ""Gift Cards"" out of guilt (let it be known these gift cards were given to them for Christmas from their works, but since they don't shop there, they don't use them).

This year, not a single biological family member called me for my birthday, even my Mom sent me a text instructing me to call her for my birthday.  I'm not in the middle of a fight with anyone, my family is just a bit too self involved and inconsiderate, and COVID has definitely amplified these traits.  If I need help with anything my dad and brother will be there instantly, but left to their own devices, they're pretty inconsiderate.

Whereas my wife's family is from a different country, don't even speak my language, and yet several of her family members called to wish me happy birthday.

I decided I was going to reciprocate everyone's bday's exactly how they treated mine.  So my mom would get a text inviting her to call me (let it be known she did have a little gift for me when we stopped by to visit for my bday, so I will also have a gift for her, if she chooses to stop by my place for her bday), and I would just ignore my dad and brothers'.

I was ready to execute on this plan, but then my dad gets terminated from his work.  He's going through a bit of depression, and is a little lost, he's close to retirement, but like everyone in todays age is concerned about his future.

I had reservations about my plan from the start, It's a bit petty (I understand this), but 10+ years of the same thing from them, has left me... a little jaded I guess.

My family has a lot of faults, but they're still my family and we love each other, but they completely forgot this year there wasn't even a 3 day follow-up, so I feel like the only way they'll know they forgot is if I don't call them for theirs (talking with him is useless, I've already spoken to him about this several times).

But now that my Dad was let go, and is going through depression about this, having his son (who calls every year) not call him, could add fuel to the depression fire. 

So WIBTA if I don't call my Dad for his bday?",,,,,3,1,1,
270,"My fiancé’s mom has a habit of getting pets that she doesn’t have time or money for, and then giving them away.

A few years ago, she got a puppy who’s quite hyper, and she never got him neutered. She also didn’t potty train him.

My fiancé moved back in with his family and had been taking care of the new dog, and took him for walks, and potty trained him.

However, my fiancé and I are getting a condo so he will be moving out. Because my fiancé is the only one taking care of the dog, his mom and sister decided to sell the dog to my fiancé’s absentee dad who never sees him and never lets him visit.

My fiancé had hinted to me about adopting the dog, but I wasn’t open to it because things have been very stressful between us lately. We have a lot of big life changes, and having a dog that’s hyper and destructive would be difficult. We’ll also be in a HOA with strict rules about dogs.


His dad took the dog very coldly in a rush, and my fiancé is very upset. I feel guilty though like I should have said “let’s adopt the dog.” AITA for not offering that option?",,,,,1,1,2,
271,"I (18NB) and “Robert” (18M) met during our sophomore and at the time I was still reeling from a traumatic move that moved me away from my friend group and forced me to adjust to an IB school system. Robert was in the school longer but is similar. According to him, he never had a real friend before I came along and I felt bad so we became friends.

Long story short, I realised after a year and half of his bull crap why he couldn’t make friends. He’s a self-absorbed prick with both an inferiority and a God complex. Robert is also obsessed with conlangs, which are basically made up languages. Especially this one specific language. He tried to FORCE me to learn it, despite the fact that I had bigger priorities than his made up language. There was also an incident where he edited photos of me to look like an often sexualised character that involves this language. In public, at school, nonetheless. I stopped hanging out and talking to him at school during my senior year as he was isolating me from my peers and dragging me down mentally.

For Christmas, when we were still juniors, he gifted me a book which was supposed to teach you to speak his made up language. I took it at the time since it was a gift. Now it is a reminder of how much he forced me into being subservient to him and I hate having it. Plus it’s not like I’ll read it. I don’t want to throw it away because it’s a book and I don’t want to waste, so I’ve been thinking about discreetly giving it back to him after our last exams (since IB exams are in progress). 

But my dad is against that. He says that as much as Robert was a prick, I shouldn’t give what was supposed to be a gift back. I suppose it would appear as being petty?? But it isn’t out of pettiness. Yet I just don’t have a use for the book anymore and don’t see why I should keep it.

272,"I have a friend group with my wife where we play a lot of different games video, board, card.

I used to game competitively in my younger days and got paid to do so I understand my competitiveness is a bit more than others but I tend to try to take things easy in casual settings.

While playing in our group I’ve noticed that a lot of times I get teamed up on constantly, and isolated to where what we are doing becomes virtually just a huge struggle of bias and unfairness.

Mainly because the group actively goes out of their way to make things harder for me even if they don’t recognize it.

In smash our first time playing everyone 3 on 1 me damn near immediately. Even in other games where there are no teams constantly but yet everyone focuses on me first and it’s ridiculous.

What made me finally say fuck this was during monopoly (I know great friend game I have literally said I didn’t want to play but got asked so much I finally accepted) I could not even get my colors or any auctions because the group consistently only traded to each other and gave me complete shit trades.

It wouldn’t be so bad but they let house rules completely ruin auctioning to where no one was even having to blow money in a bid war they just aligned themselves and made it more difficult for my plays but they did not work against each other.

It got to the point where there was no point in playing any longer and I said I was out because it was completely unfair.

The situation turned into me being childish an asshole and getting cussed at.

My wife told me that it happens because I’m a “strong player” but what does that matter if I don’t even get to play fairly in any game we play. My wife also didn’t back me up in the situation and told me that there is no bias and it only happens when I’m winning when that’s entirely untrue as they do it it immediately in some games.

At this point I feel extremely alienated in a friend group and by my wife at a time that’s supposed to be leisure. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: every game I play with friends and wife turns into everyone just going out of their way immediately even in new games to make sure I’m getting screwed over due to a bias of being a “strong player” “and I usually win anyways” so I called them out and they cussed me out.",,,,,1,2,2,
273,"We're a friend group of 4 people in total, and we're all turning 18 this year. As everyone knows, a person's 18th birthday is extremely important, so everyone plans big parties and their friends and family obviously think of the great gifts to give them for this important day.

I've always been meticulous about making personal and meaninful gifts, and this year i worked extra hard to make sure they all got nice gifts. 
The first one, E, got a kindle gift card of 30€ from us three, because we know she loves reading. The second one, S, got a whole ass kindle.
Following, there was my birthday, and i hoped to receive a nice gift, not even expensive, just personal. We celebrate and the time for presents finally comes, but i found myself very disappointed in finding a small set of gemstones which meant nothing to me or to them. I smiled and thanked them, weeks have passed, but i can't really force myself to like this gift. It doesn't represent me at all, and while it might've been a cute gift, it wasn't a gift for someone's 18th birthday. But i let it go and try not to think selfishly. 

Now it's the turn of the last friend, C, and we've been planning to make her a whole personalized card game (yes, it was about drinking, which i don't like at all, but i stuck to it since it was for my friend), so we had to order the cards, make up rules and decorate and write on them accordingly.
So E, S and me sat down and started thinking about the rules. 
S said she'd order the cards, but she ended up being disorganized and not ordering them, and if we bought them now they wouldn't come in time for the birthday, and even if they did we wouldn't have time to decorate them. 

Besides the cards they wanted to make her other 2-3 gifts: A tattoo coupon, a pair of Dr Martens, and one of those tiny heaters for wax. Of course those were way too many gifts for me to contribute, so i said no to two of them, willing to pay for the last one. 
However, S and E stuck to the card idea, and they came up with the idea of making all the cards on little paper cutouts and give them to C, and a few days later re-do all of them on the actual cards and give it to her. I replied that it would take a lot of time to do. 
E got mad at me and told me that if i didn't wanna work with them i could've just said so, and then told me that S and her would be working together without me. 

Now this thing really made me upset, i feel so disrespected, and even if it might seem selfish I'm pretty bummed out about the gemstones i got at my 18th bday, while they were getting nice gifts. 
I still haven't responded to the text message since last night, because i really don't wanna ruin the whole friendship just a few days before a birthday, but i really can't get over the fact they gave me something so effortless, and I'm very upset at E because this isn't the first time she showed me this temper. Now idk what to tell her, or what to think. AITA?",,,,,3,2,3,
274,"  

I (32m) have a nephew Josh (18m) and a niece Sarah (16F), and this argument came up when visiting my sister. 

My car is a very modified classic car, A 72 challenger with a modern motor swap, 6 speed manual, and more mods putting out over 1000 hp. It is not a beginner driver friendly car.

Josh didn’t get his license until 3 months ago, and I am pretty sure he fubbed numbers to take the test for the 3rd time. I have seen him drive once, and even offered to ride with him before to help pump his hours up and to continue to drive so he can feel more comfortable. Sarah goes to car shows with me and has a modified Miata that she drives everywhere. She got her license 2 weeks after turning 16 and has had it for 8 months now. She drove with me every day after getting her permit, and just has that drive to drive. 

Before anyone says I have my favorite, Josh and I game EVERY night, and I built him a custom PC for getting honor role. He is AMAZING at tech, loves gaming, and if he decides to continue, I will be paying for his college and will offer him a job at my business which offers specialized tech services. I have told both of them the dollar amounts I have saved up that will be for them for the future. If they want to use it for school, training, down payment on a house, travel, it will be theirs as long as they can tell me they have a plan. 

I bought both of them their first cars after they got their licenses and try to keep everything as close to fair as I can with them.

 I was over for dinner and Josh said he can’t wait for prom and was asking if he could use my car to drive his date. I told him I was not comfortable with him driving my car, and that I would gladly drive him and his date, and even wear a suit and funny hat to be his driver. He threw a fit and said that I would let Sarah take the car if she asked. I said if she kept driving and showing the control she has, I would consider it. I told him I feel he has not been driving long enough to be able to control this car, and that I would be worried for his and his dates safety. I also told him I would trust him with my PC before I’d even let Sarah play the sims on it and it’s just how they are different people with different interests. My sister said I should have just said no, but I have always told them I will never lie to them and explain myself why because they are almost adults and deserve to hear the truth. (I won’t be rude to them however). 

He has since not played games with me, and not responded to my texts. His father says I am TAH, My sister said I should have just said no but now should just let him use the car, Sarah says she would be scared to drive the car, our parents said I should have just said no. AITA?",,,,,3,2,2,
275,"For Christmas, I think maybe 3 years ago, I requested a PC so that I could play games cause the laptop I had wasn't able to run any games at all. But instead, I got another, slightly better, laptop. It couldn't ( run games very well but I can have about three small 3 games. I just have to delete one when I want another. I was still appreciative even though it was not what I wanted cause I had assumed we either couldn't afford a PC or they misunderstood what I had asked for.

My brother's (13M) birthday rolls around and when I get woken up to watch him open his gifts I see a massive box in the corner of the room and as you can probably guess it was a PC. At first I thought maybe a shared PC scenario as I had asked for one aswell and thought maybe now we can afford one or something along those lines but nope, completely his, and my parents didn't even say something to me about it. Now I think they just didn't understand that I wanted a PC as well or just didn't care (my mother especially is very traditionalist so it's also a possibility she just didn't want her daughter playing videogames)

When he first got it he let me download three games of my own that I couldn't get on my laptop (Sims 4, Valorant, and Overwatch) but over time he started letting me play less and less until in about a month it became ""(my name) get the F out/off"". This caused problems as like once every 3 days I would try and play something and would get kicked off after 20 minutes but on some other days he would let me play for a good hour

Now today, my brother had gone out to the garden to play and I got on and started playing and I had started a challenge during which you cannot save, and you cannot leave without receiving a penalty. My brother came in and immediately said ""Get out"". I ignored him and kept playing so i could try and finish the challenge as fast as possible. He told me to save and quit repeatedly but I told him ""I cant"" every time until he pulled the plug on his pc which ended up logging me out of my account and deleting all my progress. He got our mum and she was screaming at me to get out and I got a 20-minute lecture that i didn't even try to dispute and just kept quiet

I started crying cause i was jut yelled at and lost all my progress in a game i poured so many hours into and then got yelled at again for crying. And now as I'm writing this I can hear my mum complaining about me to her friend on the phone.

I am using a throwaway account.

Also English is not my first language so please forgive any mistakes.

For context we live in an apartment building on the last floor, our floor was built recently whereas the building was built in the 1960s. Therefor our flooring is different from the rest of the building and thinner.

Our neighbor from downstairs came to us once complaining that it is too loud to the point it is unbearable, my husband went down with him and listened to the sounds and it was really loud and annoying especially that we have a two year old.

So we came to the agreement that we cannot control our child 100% of the time but we will try our best to reduce the amount of stomping and stop it completely at certain times like early mornings.

Recently my MIL, SIL and niece visited and were always annoyed how we would ask them not to stomp loudly at the ""quiet times"" mandated by the building and how we would ask our daughter to not jump on the floor and direct her to jump on the rubber matt instead.

My MIL said that we are assholes to dictate how our guests should walk and that we will cause our daughter issues by limiting her movement which I disagree with since we do not restrict her movement all the time, we just limit the amount of noise that's it and we do not mind teaching her to respect others.

So reddit AITA here?

Note: we do take our daughter outside a lot and she also goes to daycare where she can jump all she wants. We also have rubber mats that absorb the sound for her to jump inside.",,,,,1,1,1,
277,"I (21f) am planning on attending a wedding abroad this summer (August). Without specifying the country, it is approximately a 1.30hr flight so it is not a lengthy journey.

My cousin is hosting a bridal party a couple of days before the wedding. She has invited every female member of her family to the party. However, I don’t plan on attending the party - only the wedding. My mother is NOT happy about this as she feels it is rude to miss the bridal party without good reason. I don’t plan on attending her bridal party for the following reasons:

1) her bridal party is about 4 days before the wedding. The tickets are much cheaper if I fly in for the wedding alone (think around £200 of a discount). 

2) It goes without saying that the wedding is more important than the bridal party. I only want to attend one event and I think it’s obvious that the wedding is prioritised.

3) I am not even close to this cousin at all. She does not live in the same country as me, however she is also not that far, we are both based in Europe and our countries are only 2hr flights apart. I have met her in person a few times, I message her a few times a year to wish her a happy birthday, happy new year etc. but you get the idea of our relationship.

I truly believe she will not be offended if I miss the bridal party. Plus, I ideally want to fly in a day or two before the wedding and fly out 2/3 days later as I’d like to focus on my work and studies here. 

My mother is insisting that it’s rude and I cannot miss the party when she told her I’d be attending. I told her that I am an adult and she cannot force me to go and I did not promise her anything. Further, I’m paying for the tickets with my own money and so I think she doesn’t have a say on what dates I choose to fly or how long I stay there.",,,,,2,1,2,
278,"I’ll try and keep this brief, in a nutshell though, my father died 4 years ago.  That same year I ended up leaving my now ex-husband. My mother has become very bitter and angry.  She drinks a lot more than she used to, and it’s become quite a task to speak to her.  She makes these horrible comments about my dad and has recently decided to make rude comments to me about my boyfriend John.   I haven’t called/spoken to my mother in 6 months.  About 6 weeks ago I decided to write my mom a letter letting her know how I feel about things.  This is the letter I sent her:

Dear mom,

I love you.  You are my mother and I don’t want you to think I am ungrateful for everything you’ve done for me.  I am writing this so I can explain why I haven’t called.   

Please stop insulting John’s intelligence.  You don’t know him that well.  It’s appalling how quick and easy it is to judge someone.  John makes me happy, I wish that was enough for you.  He has never used money or other things to control me, he will never gaslight or abuse me, and he certainly will never use my son as a tool to hurt me.  I wish this mattered to you more than John’s IQ.   

Ever since dad died you have become very despondent.  It hurts my heart every time you complain about him and speak about him like he wasn’t the man we all know he was.  I think you need to be angry at him so you don’t get sad.  This has made it very difficult to talk to you.  

I get the impression you have just given up.  You used to be active  You’d go shopping, see your friends, garden, do stained glass.  Now you barely leave your neighborhood.  I know things become challenging with age, but you’re not old enough to use that as an excuse.  

I am deeply hurt you wouldn’t testify at my divorce trial.  You wouldn’t even answer my lawyer’s phone calls.  I needed you for 1 day.  I needed 1 person- you- to tell the judge I was a good mother.  It would’ve made a difference, the judge stated that in the divorce decree.  Why wouldn’t you help me? Do you think I wasn’t a good mother?

In a nutshell mom these are the reasons why I stopped reaching out.  I would love to talk to you if you and I can come up with some healthy boundaries to allow this relationship to continue.  I’m leaving this up to you, I love you, me.  

My twin Maddy decided to go off on me via texts about this, saying that I should be ashamed of the “dumpster fire” I call a letter and that it was a vicious, hateful attack on our mom.   I responded and told her that I wrote her the letter because it was a way for me to express myself in a clear, concise manner, because talking to my mom about any non-topical issues can make me very emotional, and Maddy is the same way.  I haven’t responded to Maddy’s texts.  She texted me some random bs a few days later about genealogy or something, I believe that was her attempt to feel out the situation.

279,"I (23f) was a babysitter. I worked as a babysitter to three kids (8m), (7m), (3f). I literally raised the two younger ones from newborns to toddlers since their parents were busy with work.

I help the oldest kid with his assignments. His mother shared her worries regarding the oldest way back years ago. He wasn't good at reading. Of course, as someone who raised the kids as if they're my own, I took an initiative. I taught the kid how to read properly and even introduced him to reading short stories (I love reading so I feel like he's gonna miss out a lot if he didn't give reading a chance). Months and years have gone by and I am still helping the oldest kid with homeworks. I don't expect any incentive by doing so. I was happy to spend time with the kids because I bonded with them over the years.

Fast forward to last year. I brought up about how difficult it was to teach the oldest kid to read and reminisced it with the kid's mother, hoping that she'll share my enthusiasm over the nistalgic events especially her son grew to love reading because of my suggestion years ago. The mother then proceeded to gaslight me and told me that he learned reading from school and totally acted like she didn't remember my helping her oldest kid to read.

To be clear, I was totally happy to teach the kid without additional payment. I didn't even ask for a raise even if I was babysitting her kids for years. All I needed was a ""thank you"". A sign of appreciation. Maybe a mug or a shirt. Any token of appreciation at all. But nothing. I got nothing. No sign of appreciation. No anything.

I had enough. I stopped tutoring the kid and I evaded her vague requests about tutoring the middle child, too. I simply gave up and informed them that I will stop babysitting her kids anymore. I feel bad about my reaction towards the matter and I feel like I'm including the kids in my anger towards their mother. I love the kids so much and will always take an extra mile for them, but I just can't bear the toxicity of their mother that's why I left for good and never came back. AITA?

P.S. I didn't cut my contact with the kids, though. I am still playing with her kids on Roblox. Connecting with the kids is like connecting with my inner child since I spent most of my teen years working to support my education. I hope nobody misinterpret my connection with the children. I always loved taking care of kids, even playing with them on Roblox or PS5. Lol.

Edit: Just to clarify, I taught the kid how to read the whole summer. It is my fault for being humble with my words and didn't include the entire process since it might bore some.

The kid didn't know his letters. He confuses his small  letter ""b"" with ""d"". Yeah. He was at that level when I taught him how to read. He only knows ten letters and sometimes confuses them with one another. I taught him to recognize the letters until we got to the level where he could read ""ascertain"" without doubting himself if he read it right. It was not a big deal to me. He is a fast learner himself so he learned pretty fast. In just a few months, he can read the menus and stuff on youtube. I was proud. I was happy that the toddler I met years ago was finally learning how to read. It was fulfilling.

The issue here is how his mother gaslighted me and shrugged my contribution off as if they were nothing.

I was upset, yes. She neglected my efforts like they were nothing. That resulted to pettiness. I refused to tutor the middle child because of that. I even resigned. I was so upset because as someone who's being underappreciated their whole life, that sh*t stings.",,,,,3,2,2,

• ""You aren't the girl we raised, I'm ashamed to be                                           your mum""
I lost it. I dont like being yelled at. Alot more was said but those were the 2 main things. I've been bullied in and out of school, but hearing what my mum said isnt something I'll forget. I argued it wasnt fair and it was my life. I began to cry, my mum laughed at me. I spent the rest of the night crying and I eventually passed out. Yesterday was meant to be like every other Sunday, I got up and got ready to go to the market with my boyfriend, as I was about to leave, my dad stopped me. He said: ""if you leave to go, you may aswell not come back"". I left anyways.

I've never felt this way before, my boyfriend has been there for me. I spent a month in hospital last year, he brung stuff and visited me even though I was an hour away. His family have given me what I was missing growing up. They involve me in things, buy me gifts and love talking to me. They all make me so happy.

I went home using my key. Silence. I checked if I had food, nope. I was completely ignored. I skipped dinner. I wasn't spoken to or acknowledged. Today, the same. Its like I dont exist to them, which is fine but it sucks knowing that it's because of my boyfriend.

AITA for this, am I seeing it wrong?",,,,,1,1,1,

Anyway friend mentions like omg I used to play this all the time at my dads house (died when he was like 9/10 ish) and I just say like c’mon don’t talk about that stuff we’re just trying to have a good time. 

He says he’s not saying it to get like pity or some shit he’s just talking about it why am I being so sensitive.

Two of my kids plus myself have a rare chromosome genetic deletion which has caused my oldest to have heart problems and my other kid with severe autism. It's genetic so it comes from my parents but no one wanted to get tested till last week. My sister came to me and told me she needed consent to let her doctor get access to my medical records, no please or thanks. Then all of a sudden my mum has said you've been saying for years to get tested. But these are my private medical records along with my kids being on record aswell. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this but she has said previously that she wouldn't have a disabled kid as it's no sort of life for them so basically I should have got rid of them but I wouldn't do that.

283,"Hi Reddit, I need some advice on a situation with my friend. My friend, let's call him Tom, recently lost his job due to being fired for misconduct. He didn't disclose the exact details, but from what I gathered, he was caught violating company policies and was let go as a result.

Tom has been reaching out to me for help as he's struggling financially since losing his job. He's asked me if I could lend him some money to help him get by until he finds a new job.

I'm conflicted because while I sympathize with him losing his job, I'm uncomfortable lending money to someone who was fired for misconduct. It makes me question whether he's reliable and trustworthy enough to pay me back. Plus, I don't want to enable any negative behavior if his misconduct was related to something like substance abuse or gambling.

I haven't outright told Tom no, but I've been hesitant in my responses to him. He's been getting increasingly frustrated with me and has accused me of being unsupportive and not caring about his situation.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to lend Tom money due to his misconduct? Should I be more understanding and offer to help him out despite my reservations? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",,,,,2,2,2,
284,"My(F25) birthday was recently and it went horrible. I have a partner(M29) who isn't the best at birthdays, so for the past four years we've been together I haven't really gotten much for birthday celebration. 
He's only once taken the day off, and even that day he didn't have a choice because of an injury. Because of this, I was not expecting anything big. I was sure he would get me a gift but that was probably going to be it.

Since I wasn't expecting anything, I planned to go to the city that is an hour and a half away, to get a CT scan. And to just spend the day doing whatever I like. Maybe buy myself a cake, I can't have gluten so I didn't think he would have one(plus he'd never gotten me a cake before).

My partner knew of these plans, and didn't say much. And I knew from our work schedule that he was working. He asked a few times what time I will be home but I didn't have a timeline because I had no expectations.

When I didn't give him a time, he got upset said he had made reservations that he wanted to go to. After hearing that I asked what time and said I would make it back. But by time he said that, he had already canceled the reservations.

So I ended up going to the city anyways. Later my mom messaged and basically told me I made an ass of myself because he had planned a surprise party. But because I went to the city he canceled it and was really upset with me. They basically both put all the blame on to me. I ended up crying in the waiting room for the CT and having a anxiety attack afterwards. I felt so bad for the admin there.

Anyways, I was just wondering if it truly was my fault or if I'm valid in being upset that they didn't give me a reason to be home at a certain time?

Just a side note, my partner knows I have a really hard time not knowing plans. I really like to have a schedule, and I don't like sudden changes to a schedule.",,,,,1,1,1,

286,"So I (m20) still live at home with my parents cause of the horribly high housing prices but I technically live in a seperate room from the house thats outside and up some stairs. I also have 3 siblings: M(12) F(9) and M(7). Now that thats out of the way I'll get on with the story

So my mom recently started helping out my aunt with her selling business where she goes out to sell every morning but my mom only goes on select days to help her out. On these days I take them to school, the younger ones at 8:15 and the older on at 8:30. Then I go to work immediately after. I work every weekday but generally like the weekend to relax so I hang out with my GF. (also 20 and lives with her parents) only bad part is she lives an hour away from me so we usually hang out Friday evening until Sunday night and she stays over at my house

On this Sunday though I decided to sleep over at her place since we get home pretty late and I'm basically dozing off at the wheel sometimes plus its raining so I decided to just crash there for the night since I have done so before but before my mom started helping my aunt

I get a text from her saying who was going to stay with the kids and I forgot and didn't realize they'd basically be alone for 2 hours while I drove back and apologized, I leave pretty early in the morning so I still have time to get home and take them to school but they'd just be alone for awhile since my dad also works very early( for the record they both leave at 4am)

My mom then texts me that I can never do a favor for nothing. That kinda hurt since I'm still taking them to school I'm just not gonna be there for 2 hours while they sleep and I do it all the time for her and never once complained or asked for anything in return, plus I'm not there with them in general anway since I'm in a separate room and office type soace away from the house in the first place so they're still technically alone in the house to begin with. Id understand her frustration more if this was for her job but she's also just doing a favor for my aunt  so its not like she needs to go as well but

287,"I (20F) am friends with Anna (21F). We’ve been close since 9th grade and have always been friends since then. Anna and I are book nerds, at least Anna used to be. We bonded over several of our favorite authors and libraries were our hangouts. Anna became less and less into books when she started dating her current boyfriend. They’ve been together for 2 years and I’m happy for them but I’m also wary of him sometimes.

Anna is a gamer now because of her bf. He introduced her to Overwatch and she got addicted for weeks, then they tried playing other games like Fortnite, Valorant, Nintendo games, you know all those. Which is fine but then Anna started getting into the frankly misogynistic “gamer girl” aesthetic.

She sent me pictures of her gaming PC that she entirely built herself and just spent money on expensive figures and decorations for it. It’s also all pink. She bought pink mice and now has a collection of pink keyboards. She also changed her avatars on Discord to anime or video game avatars. She seems really into the aesthetic of girls who are pressured into a super feminine role as a gamer.

I started wondering if her bf is pressuring her into that role, so I reached out and let her know that it’s okay to still love books and you don’t have to be those gamer girls who are just obsessed with pink. She said that she just has new hobbies right now but she still loves books and she doesn’t mind hanging out with me. I told her I’m sad she doesn’t hang out anymore because it feels like her bf is just forcing her to play games.

She got really defensive and said her bf has helped her get really good at games and build her gaming aesthetic. Tho tbh I don’t get those gaming aesthetics where you spend $1000 on decorations, posters, and a parts inside of a PC that you’re never going to even use. I said that it feels like she’s contributing to a misogynistic image of female gamers and it feels pick-meish.

She responded by calling me a judgemental asshole and that she can invest in any hobby she wants. Am I really the asshole? She was never super into pink or interacting with guy gamers online in Discord 24/7 so it comes off as pick-me to me.",,,,,1,3,2,
288,"Before I start I want to apologise if I misspelled something, English is not my first language, so if something is not clear let me know in the comments, I’ll try to explain myself better.

Some context: I’ve never been close to any of my cousins, mostly because they’re all 10+ years older than me. The only exception are my uncle’s kids. My uncle’s daughter, C, is one year younger than me. When we were kids we had fun together, and she was my favourite cousin, however her mom didn’t want me to hang out with C, cause she wanted her daughter to be closer to her side of the family. She constantly complained how I shouldn’t be there (despite my uncle inviting me over his place). So, around the age of 6/7 I stopped hanging out with C. 

We didn’t have a relationship even when we were teens, and we started to use Facebook. I honestly didn’t care, cause by that time we didn’t have a relationship for years and I was struggling with depression, but this is just to say that we never had a relationship after that, even if it was possible.

In the latest 10 years we saw each other 4 or 5 times, during majors family events. Me and C usually chitchatted during those events, but nothing more. We don’t even have each other number or follow each other through social media (except Facebook, that we don’t actually use anymore). 

Now, I’ve moved in with my bf, in another city, after years of LDR. He lived in the other side of my country so it’s quite far from my family. 

In my country it’s very hard to find a job, but being the richest part of the country, here it’s easier to find a job, even better paid. 

Now, my aunt (C’s mother) asked me to host C for some months, so she can find a job and after that she would move out. She asked my mother who asked me. I told her no.

I know that it’s not C’s fault, and if there’s anyone to blame it’s my aunt, but me and my bf live in a small condo (1 bedroom and the living room), which is fine for us, and even for some occasional guest, like my friends, which never stay more than one week when they come to visit me, but it’s not ideal for 3 people. But more than that, I don’t want to host someone, who’s a complete stranger to me, for months. 

By bf isn’t crazy about the idea either, he doesn’t like having people he doesn’t know in his house, but said that if I really want to, I can host her for a couple months. 

After I said no, some relatives called me an AH and I guessing if I’m not punishing C for something that isn’t even her fault.

So AITA?",,,,,2,1,2,

A lot of people in my family have this bellpepper allergy so we learned to live around it, and it is mostly easy with sometimes the exception of eating out. In my city there are a few Mexican restaurants where bellpeppers are used often, so we call first and tell them about the allergy, asking if it is possible to eat there, they say yes and when we are there they give me/us a menu where is indicated what we should not order and there are still like 5 to 10 options, no biggie. 

A few weeks ago I had a party with some friends in another city, everyone likes mexican so we called ahead like a month before, getting a reservation and letting them know about our allergies (got a friend with another allergy). Everything was cool, they could accomodate us. Except for when we arrived it was suddenly a problem. They had nothing without bellpepper. I don't want to be a burden, thats why I always call ahead, because it always gives me anxiety if cooks have to do something different for me specially without notice. But they had like no options. Eventually they could make me something vegetarian and simple and I was very ok with it, glad that I could at least eat something and didnt held op everyone elses food anymore. Also it tasted very good and I let them know it. I did got told by the waiter: 'This is a mexican restaurant, Mexicans eat bellpepper', in an annoyed tone. 

I brought it up in my family and with other friends over the last couple weeks and opinions are divided, some say that I shouldnt go to a mexican restaurant with this allergy, others say I did everything I could and they told us they could accomodate us. I think I'm not an asshole, but will accept my judgement.

So.. Am I the Asshole for going to a Mexican restaurant while I am allergic to bellpeppers?",,,,,1,1,1,
290,"Throwaway account. 


So my partner (24M) and I (25F) have been planning a trip to Europe with my sister (25F) and her partner (26M) since about January. At that point, everyone was supper excited and importantly, my partner was consistently on board with any plans made. 

So fast forward to March, plans changed from being a Mediterranean/Italian trip to finally settling on Oktoberfest and Austria in the Fall. This change was made since although my sister and I wanted to do Italy, the boys were less enthused (my partner had spent time in Italy before and the other had wanted to do Oktoberfest and loved traveling Germany). 

Since then, my sister and I put probably a hundred hours into planning to ensure a smooth week and a half since we will be going to 5 different cities in two countries. The boys lent little to no assistance beyond nodding when prices were discussed and validating we seemed to be planning a fun trip. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago I’m visiting my partner (we are long distance) and I’m going on and on about how excited I am and how good of a job I feel we did and showing pictures of the places we’re going and he just smiled and said how he couldn’t wait to go with me. 

Then Saturday we’re on a call with other people in our friend group (including the two going on the trip) and he says he wants to talk to me about something just us. I laugh and hop off and call him (he’s been working through professional exams for his job and had spent the day studying so I assumed it was about this). Unfortunately not, he said he didn’t think he could do the trip anymore. 

From here, I asked why and where it was coming from. He started a new job a bit over a month ago, got a new car in March, and so on. He does live within his means. He was concerned about taking time off since starting a new job which I reminded isn’t until 5 months in. Then he said he’d prefer to get more paychecks and paying late June or July would be good for him and I said no problem, I can front him now and he can pay me when he can (I have a nice budget for travel so especially if he plans to pay me back, it won’t be a hardship) and ticket prices will skyrocket by then if they’re even available. He didn’t seem to like this. 

Additionally, he only told the others yesterday afternoon after they were online ready to just buy their tickets. They’re upset since they also spent months working to make this trip happen. 

Also before anyone says go without him, the trip becomes much more expensive with just three (lodging now split three ways instead of four) and honestly being on an arguable romantic trip as a third wheel sounds dreadful. 

I have told him I don’t want tangible things and how going on this would be all I’d want giftwise from him in general (I don’t value physical items and I’m able to get anything I need or want for myself, but I can’t buy his time and shared experiences). 

Anyway, AITA for being so upset and trying to get him to reconsider?",,,,,1,1,1,
291,"So it's my sister's birthday soon and I wanted to set up a little suprise dinner with family and friends.

I set up a group chat with the people I wanted to include including immediate family, our partners, both grandmothers, our aunt, her kids (our cousins) and a couple of my sister friends. There's like 14 people in this chat.

Yesterday I put a message asking for people's orders since I need to pre order the food with us being such a big party. My other sister replied saying not to bother with her kids be sure they won't eat it and their dad will feed them.

One of my grandmothers jumped in speaking to my sister about setting up a day for one of the kids to stay at her house.

I replied with: Nan can you message her directly so everyone doesn't have to see your conversation

She replied with: Tried that love.

This is where I may be the asshole... I then said: Yes but it's annoying everyone else nan

My sister actually sent a voice note saying: no you didn't? I haven't had any messages from you about having *child's name* over?

Again there's 14 people in the chat and they now have to sit and read their completely irrelevant conversation.

My Aunt (her daughter) decides to chime in with: Nan not annoyed anyone ? On this ????? 

I was having a shitty day prior to this conversation and was just done and couldn't be arsed with an argument. So I replied: 
There are 11 other people in this chat, you can't possibly speak for everyone.
Please be considerate to everyone else's phones pinging while you chat about something unrelated to the group chats purpose.
If you want to carry on, message me privately.

Aunt: You could of message Nan privately
That’s all I want to say x

Her daughter, my cousin then jumps in: Worse things going on!
Trying to see her grandchild

I decided to just shut it down as it was mostly planned at this point anyway: 
Me: Right there's no need for the chat anymore anyway.

Apologies to everyone else.

People who are eating, be at the restaurant for 5pm Tuesday 9th May and if you haven't already told me what you're eating message me privately.

People coming for a drink after, be there for 6 onwards.

And that's all that was said on the matter but I'm left feeling a bit pissed off at the situation because I feel like the only thing I said that wasn't keeping things as polite as possible was me saying she was annoying everyone else. But aunt and cousins reactions are making me second myself?

So AITA?

TLDR: my nan decided to question my sister about unrelated stuff in my other sisters birthday party group chat, I asked her to stop because the 12 other people in the group didn't want to see it, and then said she was annoying everyone else... AITA?",,,,,3,2,2,
292,"We recently moved into a large house. Before moving, it was agreed between my husband and I that we would each have our own space besides our shared bedroom. He gets the office and very large deck off of it for his exclusive use and I get the sunroom for the same. 

We’ve been here about 6 weeks now and it is not shaking out that way at all. He doesn’t use the office or deck, even to work.

He stays up late watching TV and falls asleep on the couch. He has sleep apnea and snores horribly without his mask so he says he doesn’t want to come to bed and disturb me while I’m sleeping. He won’t come to bed earlier or set his machine up so he can come to bed when he’s ready without the fuss and fumbling around in the dark.  Then in the early morning he comes into our bedroom and asks to sleep in my sunroom. 

I don’t want him to, that’s supposed to be my space, but I feel like an AH if I say no.  I am a person that needs time to myself and quiet just to be at an ok level. I like my space to be organized, clean and smell nicely and just the way I want it. I’ve given up on that for the rest of the house (though I do try, I’ve accepted it will never happen with 5 people home all day).  But it IS the best space in the house, I understand why he wants to be in there. I decorated it with great care. His office he has done nothing to but buy a cheap futon that he hates. I’ve offered to decorate it for him but he doesn’t answer me. 


Some possibly pertinent information- he works from home and is by far the primary earner. I have a small online shop that is currently taking a break while we settle into the new house. It will be based from the sunroom June 1st.  We have three homeschooled children, which I am the primary caregiver/educator for (those their main curriculum is online). We also have two young puppies that I get up with at night and in the morning. (He usually lets them out late at night and then puts them in their crates for the night).

So, Reddit, WIBTA if I told my husband no, he can’t sleep in my space?

293,"For context I am a Canadian and a woman that hangs out with a lot of French people, who often have a very different background from my own (they are in their 30s and work in the trades; I'm in my 20s with a university degree and work for the government). We have a lot of differing opinions and experiences, which is something that enriches my life. However I have noticed that the exchange of information is only without problems when they are telling or teaching me about something. They have accused me of ""always wanting to be right"", and I find this to be an unfair evaluation of the situation. For example, in the context of COVID, they have opinions about vaccination that they don't mind sharing on a daily basis. And when I share my perspective or my thoughts, they often respond, and this cascades into an argument. And I am accused of always wanting to be right, yet I'm just sharing my differing opinon, as they do. Another more recent example: my french friend who has been in canada for 6 years and works in restaurantation tells me that construction workers earn 50,000 a year for holding up a stop sign. I say, that probably isn't right, and not all construction jobs have awesome pay, and I am accused of always wanting to be right.

294,"I (28F) went to a local park yesterday with lots of open green space near a local university. It was a nice day and being in England as soon as the sun comes out everyone (including me) flocks to the park to enjoy an ice cream and some fresh air. I arrived and found a space away from other people to lie down and relax. I was really enjoying taking some time with no distractions to listen to the sound of the birds, the kids playing in the distance and the gentle breeze.
After about 10 minutes a group of 4 people probably in their late teens-early 20s came and sat about 2 metres away from me despite there being plenty of space further away which would be just as nice and sunny. I didn't mind them sitting there but they immediately started being loud and obnoxious, and started playing music on their phone speaker (Sean Paul among other things). Not only did they play this music full volume the girls started ""singing"" along badly to the point I couldn't ignore it anymore.
I let this go on for 10 minutes or so before asking them politely if they could turn their music off because they're disturbing the peace and quiet, and not everyone wants to hear Sean Paul. They looked at me like I was an alien and said no because it's a public park, if I didn't like it I could move elsewhere, despite the fact I was there first! I tried to stay calm and said yes, it is a public park so they should respect that and not be obnoxiously loud. They got mad and told me f*ck off if I don't like it and no one else seems bothered.
I decided not to pursue it any further and just left, but AITA for thinking it's entitled and rude to play music on loud speaker and scream along to it in a public place?

This is normally fine, sometimes I’ll have to ask him to quiet down a bit because he’ll play until late hours into the night/early morning when I am trying to sleep.

Well this last night his best friend came over. They’ve been friends since elementary and he only sees him every couple weeks to one-two months because of their busy work schedules (I will add they play games online with each other almost nightly and talk on the mic, I know that’s different than physically hanging out but they usually just sit and game when they hang out anyways)

Well, it got into the very late/early morning hours and they were talking very loudly in the gaming room right outside my bedroom door, I don’t work tomorrow so I didn’t say anything until maybe 3:30am/4:00am, and just asked them to turn down the games volume because I could hear it over my tv. They still kept talking loudly after this and finally at about 5:30am I VERY politely asked them to quiet down and apologized because I knew they were having fun, but I need sleep and I can’t stay up until crazy hours in the morning like them.

They quieted down but I cant help but feel the annoyance from my boyfriend since they haven’t seen eachother in a while and might not for another while.

A few years ago our direct neighbor decided to hold a week long children’s camp in their backyard. At first in seemed like a nice initiative and we didn’t have any problems with it. Things started to stir up last summer when the one week camp transformed into a whole summer thing with 15-20 children screaming and playing outside every 2-3 days during the week and sometimes during the whole weekend. European houses don’t have AC, we usually just open the windows but last summer we either opened the windows to hear the sound of a straight up kindergarten the whole afternoon or just close everything and stay in the hot house. We had enough during my finals week at Uni when I could barely study in peace and kindly messaged them to take into consideration keeping the outside playtime to a minimum during this time to which they blocked me and installed a higher fence, as if it’s going to keep the noise down.

Summer is coming up and it after weeks of noise we messaged them again this Sunday that we do not agree with this activity and the noise they are making but they do not wish to compromise, they just bring arguments in their favor, saying it’s for the children. So AITA?",,,,,2,3,1,

I am very explicit about not wanting gifts for birthdays or any other kind of celebration because I live a very minimalistic lifestyle and would rather save up money to buy myself nicer things when I graduate and have my own place. My sister and I have gotten into arguments before about buying gifts (especially as she tries to buy me makeup, accessories, and other feminine things which I don’t use at all). I am not averse to receiving money as a gift as I like to save up to pay for tuition fees for my studies alongside my part time job. Another issue I have with gifts is that usually when my family give me gifts it’s almost always things I will never use or things that I do not like and it makes me feel like they don’t pay attention enough to my personal life or interests. I have discussed with my other sisters 21F and 24F about returning the dress, which is not my style and isn’t designed to fit me, to my sister so she can get a refund. But both have called me TA and have said I am being ungrateful by not accepting the dress. Personally I do not see what is wrong with what I am doing because I have already made it clear many times before that I do not want to receive gifts for special occasions and my sister had already told me she wouldn’t buy me any gifts after an argument we had, however she has gone back on her word and bought me the dress.

And then I told them they were annoying for what they did cause they could've called to let us know they were busy and we could've gotten our own food.


I admit I was already pissed because we're suppose to be a group of friends, and yet every time we're together, two or three of them would get away slightly and start whispering together and giggling. Sometimes they'd tell us they're going to the bathroom quickly and then they disappear. I don't mind if they want to talk about something that they don't want us to know about but I find it extremely rude when we're standing together and they call each other and start whispering by themselves. They used to include me in the whispers but I'd always tell them it's rude to do that in front of our other friends and that if they wanted to talk privately about something they should do it when we're alone, but they didn't see my point and thought i was exaggerating. One of our other friends even got upset about that and felt like she wasn't included and stopped hanging out with us for a while and i had to talk to her to tell her we care about her and stuff. 

Now I'm not sure if I'm in the right by being pissed or if it's not that big of a deal, and I'm just jealous. I admit i was jealous at the beginning, but I feel like now I'm more annoyed cause I find it rude when they do it, and they were annoying today. Especially cause they even lie to me/us sometimes.",,,,,3,3,1,
300,"My sister asked me to babysit my niece who is 16 while she is on a cruise. Last summer my niece traveled with my mother and I on a road trip, and when we got back to my house my niece called her mother to tell her what a filthy dump my house is and to come get her. Granted I’m not that into house cleaning, but I’m not a hoarder or anything I have 6 dogs and there is frequently dog hair and mud on the floor. 
So now she needs a sitter but she wants me to stay at her house. I am traveling the week before and would like to stay at my home since I don’t get paid for this. I have things I need to do at home. I have a feeling if I say anything I will be accused of ruining her vacation :(",,,,,3,1,1,
301,"I (16 F) are close friends with my cousin (16F) but she can really annoy. 
My cousin is gorgeous but her personality over the last few years has changed. She has become a jealous person who always has to one up you. 

I win an award; she has to win two more the next year. I want a scholarship for a college; suddenly she wants a scholarship for the same college. 
Recently I have began to like a close friend of my cousin &amp; I. Thinking what could the harm be I consulted her about my feelings. I have also never been in a relationship but my cousin has been in plenty so thought I could seek advice from her. However, my Cousin tell me that she feels the same way about this boy without ever expressing interest previously, suddenly she is all over him.
She went from never messaging him to always messaging him, hanging out with him &amp; “being madly in love”. 

Last night my cousin rang me deciding to “give me a friendly heads up” that I will never have a chance with this boy because he is to infatuated with her.(she has rejected this boy before and broke his heart.I also offered to back off when she admitted her feelings but she didnt do the same for me) 
I had pulled the boy aside the same day &amp; talked to him about my feelings and my cousins. he told me that he would like a possible relationship with me when things with cousin die down in hopes to not ruin my relationship with her (which I found sweet). 
I was happy to let her go on thinking she could have it her way until she began to degrade our friend calling him to ugly for her, dumb &amp; the r slur (he has disabilities which he’s sensitive about) for thinking she would get with him.  

This is where I snapped &amp; laid it into her. I told her she was a spoilt,jealous brat that doesn’t know the difference between right &amp; wrong. I said how she uses her dad cheating as an excuse but she has turned into a copy of him &amp; she will head down the same path of a 30 year old drug addict scumbag like him if she doesn’t change. The conversation ended with her crying &amp; me continuing to rip into her for a few minutes before hanging up &amp; calling our friend to tell him what was said before a story can get told.  

When I arrived at school the next morning (today) I was pulled into the office to find my aunt, uncle, cousin &amp; crush sitting inside. Friend looked uncomfortable, aunt looked angry &amp; my cousin was balling her eyes out clearly displaying fresh ‘scratches’ on her.
My family thinks I was too harsh on her yet my crush understands why I did it. I think she needed to hear it since she’s never been told no. I’m suspended from school until I agree to apologise to her which I refuse to do until she apologises. I’ve been told I’ll be moving classes &amp; to stay away from our friend because ‘he is causing to much drama’ my family+school believe I should let my cousin have him

AITA in this situation? Did I take it to far?  Should I back off &amp; let her have our friend?",,,,,4,3,1,

I moved out of home a while ago to go to college and found a one bedroom real cheap in a city. It was only $700 because it was affordable housing and the area was not good and I just had this entry level job I did part time while also taking classes. My mom suddenly got fired and got a new job in my city but lived liked 3 hours away. So I told her she could sleep on my couch as long as she needed and she did for like a semester. Then I got accepted into graduate school and knew that while I could still afford the apartment there might come a time it would be difficult since I would have to attend full time classes. My mother who often complained I lived in the “hood” wanted us to move into a house together in a better area. I agreed knowing that my finances might get less secure in the future. Now note that we moved and my rent is still $700 living with my mom but it is a large house (3 bed 2 bath $2200). I said we should get a roommate to make it more affordable but she didn’t want to.  in a nice area (my mom pays 3/4 the rent because she makes like three times the amount I do. I lend her money fairly often because even though she makes more she’s bad at managing her money) Recently I got my masters though I haven’t started working and she’s already talking about raising my rent to $1200 so it’ll be a more even split which In my city you can get a decent one bedroom for.

She could have said no but she decided to do something nice for me and lend me a lift to school for the next couple of weeks.

305,"Me 23 and my sister 20 have always been very close. My sister loosely talks to my parents still while I have gone no contact. The father of her child is not in the picture anymore as of right now. So she is a young single mum with a two year old and little to no support system.

A year ago my sister starting seeing a guy. He did not seem to care that she had a child and was overall really sweet. It started off great. I also really liked him and was very excited for her to have found a genuinely nice and caring partner as she had such bad luck previously. He never met my nephew as my sister is very careful in that regard.

Sadly this didn’t last as more and more red flags started to show up. He was out every weekend partying, lying about who he was with, lying about girls he was texting, you get the gist. It got really toxic between the two of them. My sister got paranoid and controlling. They went no contact multiple times. But these two just can’t get enough of eachother so it keeps on going. 

After a couple months I decided I had enough.  She kept making excuses for his behaviour. We argued about it a lot. It got to a point where I told her I won’t babysit my nephew anymore just for her to visit him. I will gladly take care of him if she has any other plans but babysitting for her to go see him was off the table. I told her I can’t support this kind of relationship as it was also negatively impacting my nephew.
That arrangement worked out for a little while but I was too soft to stick to this 100% all the time so there were definitely exceptions made.

Fast forward she finds out he had sex with two other girls he met on tinder. My sister said she was done and it was over for real.

Well fuck me. Of course it wasn’t. As soon as my nephew was in daycare she would go over to his place. I found out through parking tickets she left in her car. She freaked out and told me it’s my fault she didn’t tell me cause I would have judged her and she could not stand me judging her right now when she was already down and struggling. Fair enough. Cant even lie she was right. I just kept my composure and pushed it aside because honestly? I felt like my brain was going to explode. 

I am losing my mind over this. I feel so bad because my sister is almost all on her own and I can understand the pressure of it getting to you. To her I am completely in the wrong. This is how my sister sees the situation:

- I restrict her in her freedom because I only babysit in certain situations

- she would have no issue if I didn’t babysit at all it’s just that I decided to not babysit for this one specific reason

- she says I am acting like her mother by refusing to babysit because I think the guy is no good for her

- it’s unfair because the only free time she gets for them is when I babysit or when my nephew is in daycare and I am taking that away from her

306,"I (34F) lost my mom (I’m the only child) suddenly almost 7 years ago. I was raised by her as she was a single mom. My family and I were kind of close. Grandmother has always offered her home if you needed to move back home. But the family still had significant distances between us as far as complete trust and communication.

When my mom passed suddenly, I was there. I woke up to find her deceased. We have lived together since I was born. I’ve only moved out briefly when younger. My mother would stay at home, since retiring, and help me with my kids. My daughter was one and Mom was showing signs of sickness. It got to a point to where it was dangerous for my mom to watch my daughter due to her not being able to stay awake. I ended up quitting my job a week before tragedy struck.

My mom is the middle child of my grandparent’s three kids. She always told me of her upbringing and how she always felt left out or emotionally hurt by my grandmother. 

Fast forward to the day after discovering my mom deceased in her bedroom, I’m told by my grandmother to “Put my big girl panties on”. I was horrified at the lack of care in her voice and emotions that she didn’t display. I was 28 years old and never planned a funeral or anything similar to that and it was all put on me and left for me to do.

Weeks after mom’s passing, the kids and I are on the verge of being homeless. Grandmother did not offer for us to move in with her nor really accepted when I asked. For months my kids and I were spilt up and separated. My sons were with my father and my daughter with her dad. I slept in my car, slept on couches and went hungry for months. Doing odd jobs here and there for food and to support my children. Without really hearing from family or being apart of family dinners, holidays or anything. After a year I was finally in a good space to get an apartment and eventually I married and stayed away for a few years. Only communicated every once in a while with a few visits here and there. During these years I have dealt with Major Depression, anxiety and PTSD. I have been in therapy as well as seeing a psychiatrist. I have learned my boundaries and to be honest it could possibly have made me less sensitive to certain things and people. 

My family believes that I should not feel like my mom’s passing was the traumatic event that it was for me and I should be more sensitive to my GMA (83) who lost her daughter (61) for Mother’s Day. I know my mom was a sister, daughter and everything else, but I have the rest of my life to live without a mom or dad! They believe I’m selfish because I felt left out, abandoned and disowned by my family and I express to them how traumatized I am for losing the only person I feel ever truly lived me. AITA for not empathizing with GMA?",,,,,1,1,1,
307,"Me (25F) had initially agreed to the plans my friend (23F) had made for us. Since our birthdays were right next to each other, we thought it would be a good idea to celebrate together. I initially had agreed because it seemed like a good idea. Our birthday is two months from now. However, last night, my parents told me they’d appreciate if I spent my birthday with them this year since I haven’t been able to since I started working at 20. I felt bad and agreed. I immediately told my friend this and communicated how I wanted to make it up to her. She immediately shut off and acted silent and distant. She said it was okay but she left me on read when I tried to ask if everything was ok. I don’t understand? Would she rather I lied to her? Or tell her last minute? Did she expect that I’d say no to my parents and go with her instead?

Edit: A lot of people have been saying I should add more context so here it is (sorry this is my first time posting!) 

My friend planned a two day weekend trip for her birthday and since our birthdays were next to each other, she figured we’d celebrate it together. I agreed and we looked into some things we could do. Everything is still at the planning stage at this point. I also need to clarify that the trip isn’t ONLY the two of us, of course. We have other girls coming who are mostly her friends since this was originally her idea (I don’t mind either, I don’t have much friends and her friends are super civil with me). However, when my parents called recently and asked if it’s okay for me to celebrate with them for the first time in five years, I couldn’t say no. I’ve been working non-stop since I migrated and now that I had the money to fly back to my home country, being on the vacation with my friend just felt wrong. I also owe a lot to my parents since they’ve worked day and night to be able to bring me to where I am now. I also do work 7 times a week because I have 3 different jobs I attend to. 

Of course I told my friend this, but she acted cold and distant. It’s been five days and I’ve been trying to contact her but she’s left me on read and blocked me on some of our socials. It really hurts me that she couldn’t see my side even if I was really understanding of hers. I know it was hurtful for me to cancel but I didn’t entirely ghost her. In fact, I told her that we can celebrate another way in another time where it could be just the two of us since I felt so bad. I’ve already said sorry but I was also hoping she’d also understand my part. When you’ve been financially struggling all your life and when you’re finally able to afford to give back to your parents, this really was an opportunity I couldn’t pass out on.

Update: Been reading all your replies and it really has given me a wider and broad POV with this whole situation! I do see the error of my mistakes in this and have been taking accountability. I really did try to communicate right away on what i can do to make it up to her (and if we can find a compromise) however, it seems like she really isn’t willing. I can’t really force her to forgive me but I’m glad I got to share this entire situation with this community ??",,,,,3,1,1,
308,"Throw away account, I (24F) only see my family at special events (Christmas, significant birthdays, weddings, etc) since I moved to another country and can't afford to get a plane ride to see them often. My girlfriend (25F) and I have been dating for 3 months and so we are not serious enough for her to come to family events and so she has only met my parents. So my SIL (34F), brother (36M), my niece (14F), and my two nephews (both 12M) stayed at my house while visiting me. The first night I woke up in the middle of the night and went to get some water when I heard something coming from the spare room my niece was staying in so I went to check on her, what I saw honestly made me sick to my stomach, she was watching some NSFW videos me and my girlfriend made. When she saw me she shut the computer immediately, I decided I would just delete the videos the next day instead of confronting her about that because I'm not her parent. The next day I decided to tell my brother and SIL in the morning before dinner where they were going to meet my girlfriend, they didn't know this it was supposed to be a surprise. Then I left the house with my nephews to give them some privacy when they spoke to her. From what I heard from my brother, my SIL essentially interrogated her about it so she broke down and come out to them, and my SIL flipped out and told her that when they get back she would have to find a new place to live because 'that disgusting sin would not happen under her roof' (what I didn't know about my SIL is she is a devoted Christian and believes that homosexuality is a sin) its safe to say I canceled the dinner with my girlfriend and they left that day.",,,,,2,,1,2

My bf is just not looking forward to it. He had a fight with his parents because they wanted him to wear a nice suit and he hates fancy clothes. I told him it was stupid to argue with his parents about something like that but he wouldn't listen and now his mom picked his entire outfit and of course he hates it even though it actually looks good. His mom got him a suit with a white shirt and a bow tie. His Mom sent me a photo and I think the outfit is super cute. 

Now he keeps asking me if I could cancel for Saturday because he will be so embarrassed when I see him in this outfit. I find the fact somehow so sweet and would be extremely excited to see him dressed up like that. It would also be rude to his parents, who were kind enough to invite me.

310,"Throwaway. While the title may make it seem pretty cut and dry, there are some mitigating factors that complicate who is the AH in this situation, at least in my opinion.

In arguments with my boyfriend, he’ll often accuse me of forgetting or misrepresenting his words or mine through the argument. Now the issue. One conversation (not the night of the incident) I’d become frustrated with this and said how sick I was of being told I didn’t know what happened throughout our arguments. I felt like he was making me out to be a crazy person and I didn’t believe that I was consistently misunderstanding things when I’d never had this problem before. I suggested we record an argument so we can listen back and see what was actually said. He agreed, feeling it would prove the opposite to me.

Onto the actual night: at some point during the start of an argument, he was talking and I remembered the idea to record. Not wanting to interrupt, I tapped record on my smartwatch, and we continued to talk. Once there was a lull I said I’d started recording and he was shocked and immediately angry. I reminded him of our recent conversation, but he was livid that I thought it was okay to record him without saying so first. I said that I’d thought it was okay because we’d talked about it, and I hadn’t wanted to interrupt, but that I could just stop it and delete it — and thats what I proceeded to do. 

It’s been a year since this incident and he will still bring it up as something unforgivable. Obviously, its not good to record people without their knowledge, so I may be the AH, but I felt like it was something we’d talked about and agreed to. Once I saw he took issue, I deleted it immediately. So, AITA?",,,,,1,,1,3
311,"Throwaway account as I have friends and family on here.

I am a young adult female and eldest daughter at 23. I have a younger sibling of 20.

Our parents divorced when we were both very young (me 7, sibling 4). Staying with my Mom, I got told a lot of what went on in their marriage and what was going on in their divorce and as I got older I got told more of their communications regards us kids and about how difficult he was being. They didnt talk to each other - everything was by email so we never overheard any conversations. Just what we were told . My Dad never said anything about discussions with my Mom and I figured it was because he was usually in the wrong and was being the asshole regards arrangements.

Now that I'm an adult I feel like I've only heard one side of the story and when I did ask my Dad about things (when i was younger) he'd  say ""its nothing for you to worry about, it's adult discussions""

WIBTA if i arranged a meeting for the three of us (not my sibling at this stage) and I sat them down and asked pointed questions about specific memories I have?

That one really hurt and I'd  like for it be brought up where theres no ""he said she said"" and I can maybe get some closure on what it did to me? Why didn't he want me? Why wouldnt he take care of me while Mom was away?

He said the security was super lax and that the workers didn’t pay proper attention, so he grabbed a chocolate bar, a carton of milk and some bread and only payed for the bar, then took it all home with him. It’s been really bugging me and my mom caught on over dinner, so I told her about it.

Our neighbor Adam (not a real name) has a outdoor kitty, Viky. She usually walks with us when we take the dog out. We also leave cat food leftovers  and some kibbles outside and she likes to come and eat them.
Onto the situation.
Four days ago she came up to us with a terrible injury on her left eye. I won't go into the details as it was awful, but someone most likely shot her (we have some crazy person shooting dogs/cats here, not the first occurance). Only her left eye was affected but it was BAD. 
We immediately contacted Adam insisting he takes her to the vet as soon as possible. He assured us he's going to do something.
4 days later we haven't seen her outside so we assumed she's getting the care she needs.
Well, later that evening she once again came up to us whilst we were out with the dog and guess what- her eye is even worse than before and very much untreated. This time we took her inside (bathroom, as we have cats of our own) and once again texted Adam. This time he responded that he'd rather wait and not "" put her under some veterinary experiments"" (???). We insisted she's doing very badly- now she moves in slow motion, can hardly walk, doesn't eat nor drink, the eye is constantly bleeding and has a fever. 
ONCE AGAIN we texted him that it's very urgent and she needs help ASAP, but he didn't respond (he had around 12 hours to do so).
We don't have the money nor a car to even get her to the vet, but we do have an acquaintance in a shelter (in my country they're all no kill) who agreed to take her in. We didn't contact Adam to tell him this, as it was very urgent. At that point she couldn't even lift her head.
Now that she's out of our hands I'm wondering though- AITA? Maybe there was a more diplomatic way of dealing with this. I do feel like a bit of an a-hole. btw- we might follow up with animal abuse claim against them. *MINI UPDATE- yeap, she's been shot. the shelter contacted us. she's going to lose her left eye but thankfully won't lose her life..",,,,,1,,2,2

My sisters (Freya 25F and Nina 19F) and I (23F) started horse riding when we were kids (I was around 9). We all started the same year, so Nina started younger than us.

I stopped horse riding the year I turned 18, when I finished high school and went to uni. I did not want to get my driving licence yet (car crash a year before, I have severe anxiety issues and panicked at the idea of driving) but it did not feel right to ask my parents to drive me when I was technically old enough to drive myself. Freya stopped the same year too, Nina is the only one still doing it.

Nina turned 18 last year, and from then on my parents told her that 1) they would not pay for horse riding anymore because they have to pay for all of our studies and flats in the city we study in (I and Nina share a flat), and 2) they would not drive her there anymore as she’s old enough to get her licence (she did not want to yet). It was the exact same deal they presented me with the year I turned 18, which I turned down for the reasons mentioned above. Nina took it, paid for it with the money earned while working in the summer, and shared a ride with a lady from our town or used mom’s bike.

Now, my main hobbies are playing games (free games or puzzle games I buy myself), writing, and baking/cooking. We both come home every weekend and I spend an average of 10 hours over two days baking/cooking (sometimes a little less if I’m lazy, or more if I make complex things). I’m definitely not a pro, but a) I’ve been baking for years, b) I study baking in my spare time with professional books and videos, and c) I went to a few workshops in professional bakeries.

I adore baking and cooking, but I tend to overwork myself a bit on weekends to the point I’m not really rested at the end of it. I will usually make at least 1 actual dessert and 1 snack (biscuits, meringues, whatever else) per weekend, sometimes more, plus 1 or 2 meals (which are often longer meals to prep, like lasagna or sushi) so mom does not have to cook too much on her weekends.

Now, onto the issue: my parents pay for my hobby. They pay for ingredients (I only pay for professional-grade ingredients like vanilla beans), and for any baking supplies I need like baking tins or piping tips. Ingredients cost them around €12/weekend, and baking supplies cost them less than €5/month since I have a good amount already, and sometimes buy myself a specific thing I’m missing. I of course do not make them pay any of the labour cost (that would go up to around €80/weekend, depending on how many things I make).

According to Nina, I am the asshole for having my hobby paid for almost entirely by our parents, when hers is not (horse riding costs her \~€100/month). I might be the asshole for letting them finance MY hobby since I could pay for everything myself. I bake to make them happy, but it's also to have fun myself.

So, AITA for letting my parents pay for my hobby when they don’t pay for hers anymore?",,,,,1,,1,2

316,"My sister suffered a very bad miscarriage last year. This was not her first but it was the miscarriage that put her in the hospital for two weeks and left her unable to be pregnant again. She has always longed to be a mother and now she knows she can never give birth to her own biological child. It has been a lot for her.

Along with that she has been a stepmom for 8 years to 17 and 16 year old girls and a 14 year old boy. She loves those kids fiercely, and has grown to see them as her kids. But those feelings are not reciprocated and a few months ago she heard that from all three of her stepchildren in a therapy session. She sobbed her heart out to me over it. She told me she really had believed they had built up a relationship where she was now their mother too and where they wanted to be her children, where they loved her. She said it never bothered her what they would call her but that she thought she would at least be loved back, that it wouldn't be this tragic one sided bond.

Her husband has tried reassuring her through assuring her that his kids will likely realize they love her and she is their mother when they are older. He has told her he bets she will be Mother of the Brides and Groom one day, and will be grandmother to their future grandchildren.

She has been crying to me a lot. She has admitted she has been crying every day since she miscarried the last time. She told me how people have told her adoption is an option and all she can think is how much it would pain her to share the role of mother, that she knows what it's like to not be fully accepted, to not truly be mom to the children and she doesn't think she could do it. I told her it was better to accept that about herself than to take a step that wouldn't work for her, or for the potential child. I then brought up that therapy could help her come to terms with everything. Therapy was recommended by the doctor when she was released from hospital but she was very against the idea. She refused any follow up calls about that also. I told her I love her and she can always talk to me. But she might feel better if she has a professional help her through it. She got angry at first, from her body language, then she cried harder and told me it scared her. I reassured her the best I could.

Her husband was furious with me. He said therapy doesn't work for everyone and how I was suggesting therapy because I don't think his kids are kind enough to love and embrace her one day in the future, that he knows it's what I really think and that is probably why I am pushing her to ""accept how things are"". I told him even if his kids do accept her one day, it won't help her with the grief of her losses and the loss of the baby she wanted to have so badly. He said it wasn't my place to talk to her about this. That it was his. And I suggested therapy for the wrong reasons.

317,"So a friend of mine has invited me to attend a special box at a sporting event, which happens to be on Mother's Day. Our family is not celebrating Mother's Day on the Sunday as all of my nephews have sporting commitments, but we are doing a dinner all together on the Saturday night. Including my MIL and my parents as well as we all get along really well.
So we don't have any plans for Sunday. My husband had already indicated he wanted to watch our nephews sport so we definitely didn't have plans. 
I have a 2 year old daughter with my husband. I literally do everything for her, cook, clean, feed her, change her nappies and bath her. Plus I work part time.

So after being invited to attend this special box at a sporting event I had to tell my friend I'd double check with my husband and get back to her asap. He got upset and told me he wanted to go to soccer and wanted us to do this as a family.  Now we regularly go to my nephews games, however he spends the time watching the games, and I spend the time playing with and entertaining our daughter. So going to these games is not new or special.  He then said ""it's mother's day you have to spend time with our daughter"", he then informed ""no you can't go, because I want to go to the soccer games"" and ""I don't want to have her on my own""

AITA for wanting to go and not spending the afternoon with my daughter on Mother's Day? And expecting my hubby to actually parent for an afternoon??",,,,,1,,2,3
318,"Me and my girlfriend Karla (fake name) live in a suburb of Los Angeles.

She's 34 in 6 weeks time, and she said to celebrate she wants to do an all-day drinking binge and visiting of takeaway pizza and taco places, starting at 9am and finishing at midnight.

She expects me to do this with her, we go to all the bars and dive bars we can fit in.

We're a femme lesbian couple who've been together for 5 years and moved in together by summer 2019. If that makes any sense, we were together for 18 months, moved in by summer 2019.
Just as well, as by winter 2019, COVID-19 was starting to be in the news, wasn't it?

I met Karla in 2018 in a dive bar and she was sad that no women approached her, only old guys in their 50s with beards, not beautiful young women like me (her words not mine!); said it was good for beer, poor for dates.

I've told her no, but she said ""I did what you wanted for your birthday, all the fashion and lingerie stores, and it was fucking awesome, but I've never done this before, and it's worth a go. The pandemic made me realize life's too short."".

She's just as into femme fashion as me - we're lesbian and don't fit the mold of masculine-feminine lesbian couples.

We're both self-employed, so no bosses to tell about this.

I'm worried it'll make us feel ill, but she claims ""When I was sixteen, I ate a load of M&amp;M's packets - about 20 and eight bags of tortilla chips - to cope with realizing I was lesbian and realizing it was OK, and I didn't suffer any ill effects. This is it, but on a bigger scale.""

The big question is, AITA for being concerned over this?

319,"I (23 f)  had an argument with my sister (31 f) few days ago, here some context: 
So towards the end of September 2018  my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer it was very difficult for all the family but we did our best to support and help her. 


Towards the end of 2019 my sister moved in another country (she was not leaving with us anyway) mom was doing good an we all agree that she had to go and with the promise that I would join her when mum was better.


I moved one year later in 2020, my sister helped me in everything and I'm really glad for this but sometimes she was acting like she's my mom which used to lead us into fights (classic relationship between sisters love and hate).


In march 2023 I went to visit my mom for one week (my sister went one week after me whit her boyfriend) mom told me that she was diagnosed with bone cancer and have to do all the chemio terapy again, so me and my sister decided to start visit mom more often to help her (I used to visit her at least once a year).


So now comes the issue, after I lost my previously job I started work as freelance wich means that the days I don't work I don't get paid, 


The day we had the argument I text my sister to tell her that I had decided to go back home for Christmas and that it would be nice if she too came with her boyfriend to spend Christmas with the family since we hadn't spent Christmas with mum for years; 
she replied that we first had to organize to go for mum's birthday which will be at the end of July I told her that I could not be there since at the end of June I would go to visit my paternal grandmother since I hadn't seen her since I was 5 years old (my grandfather is dead) and that my job and my economic conditions did not allow me to face 2 trips in such a short time. 


So she start to complain that's my fault if i don't have the money to afford 2 trips cuz I'm the one that decides to work with a freelancer contract and that I should priorities my mum to my grandma or find the money to do both, and that she would be able to make both trips easily (My sister hasn't worked for a year now so her boyfriend pays for everything bills and rental house too he have a really well paid job so he don't mind pay for everything).


Her words really hurt me cuz she knows that after i lost my job I spent a lot of time searching for another one and didn't had many choices when I found my current one, I started cry I was feeling guilty.

So I called my mom to ask if she was okay with my decision, she was very happy that I would finally see my grandma (expecially cuz she's losing her sight) and the rest of my father's family and that if she was feeling well by then she would be happy come with me. 
Hearing her words made me feel better but part of me thinks i'm doing the wrong thing.


Ps: my sister and I don't have the same father my mom raised us by herself because my sister's father died when she was 8 and my father never cared about me and he went no contact with his family.

320,"AITA for ""Spoiling"" a Videogame for my Boyfriend

My boyfriend (18M) and myself (18F) play a game. (I'll ommit the name of the game to avoid potentially spoiling anything)

It's not multiplayer so we're forced to play alone. The game is chat based and the player is tasked with being a barista at a coffee shop while characters come in and out throughout the days chatting about their lives and progressing the story. He and I both started the second game and I assumed we were on the same day but it turns out I was one day ahead of him. (meaning different characters were at the coffee shop for me)

I mentioned the name of one of the characters( let's call them Ben)  that were in the previous game while playing and he asked me who I was talking about. So I answered and he still didn't know who I was referring to. So I recapped Ben's story arc from the last game which also involved another character and he realized who I was speaking of. I should also mention we were having this conversation over the phone on call.

After that, I started playing the game again and ""brewing"" drinks while saying things like ""milk, tea, cinnamon, why isn't this working!"" Etc. And my boyfriend said ""that's it! I'm deafening!"" (Deafening, means that his mic will be muted so he can't hear me and my audio won't relay to him either) I thought he was joking but I ended up talking to myself for a bit :/

I messaged him and asked him to undeafen and he said he wouldn't because he didn't want me to ""spoil anything else"". Which I found odd so I asked what exactly I spoiled and he told me that I told him that characters from the previous game were in the second one. But those characters were already in the first game and HE ASKED ME to tell him who I was talking about. 

I personally get pretty intense when it comes to spoilers and I don't condone spoiling media for others which is why I never do it however I don't think I spoiled anything for him. I told him nothing about the dialogue or the plot. And this game isn't the kind where a character appearing in the second game would be some huge plot twist. All I did was answer his question and recap the last games events for him. So I don't consider what I did a spoiler.

Not to mention before I started playing the second game, he told me that a character from the first game wouldn't be in the second game much. And I told him this to explain how similar both our comments were but his excuse was ""the game developers already realeased that information themselves"". Personally I never knew anything about that and I didn't consider what he did a spoiler at the time so I don't understand why he considers my actions to be spoiling the game for him.

He's mad at me now and says that he doesn't understand why I won't apologize for spoiling the game when I ""clearly did"". I think this is a contradiction in beliefs of on what it means to ""spoil"" something. Please don't hate on him or myself in the comments and keep everything respectful.",,,,,1,,1,3
321,"My (F23) sister (F28) is currently engaged and preparing for her wedding. For the longest time, she has wanted to go to Maldives. So, fBIL and she decided to make it their honeymoon destination. The trip was their wedding gift from her FIL. For context, EVERYONE in our family and BIL's family knows about her wish to visit Maldives.

We are Indians and this is an arranged marriage situation so she was planning the trip outfits and photograph ideas and itinerary with her to-be SIL as a ""family-bonding"" activity. They exchanged links of outfits they saw online and everything was going well.

So, the other day my sister and a few aunts and I were doing some wedding related work (packing favors and other return gifts for the guests) when my sister's face suddenly fell (she was on her phone). Apparently, her future sister in law and her husband took an impromptu trip to Maldives three weeks before the wedding. They stayed at the same resort where my sister was supposed to be staying, but at a better/pricier room. It was almost as if the SIL and her husband had the same exact trip but upgraded with more activities/experiences.

My sister found out about their trip while scrolling through Instagram. She didn't say anything and just handed the phone to me. Obviously I was shocked because I knew that was a very deliberate decision as the sister-in-law is the golden/pampered child of that family. I just sighed and shrugged and said ""good luck, you'll need it there"" and my SISTER BURST INTO TEARS and left the room.

Later, mom and a few other aunts TORE ME A NEW ONE yelling at me about how I made my sister cry with my comments about her new family. They said I was poisoning her head by manipulating her into thinking that her new family was BAD. They said that my sister doesn't OWN Maldives and that other people can go there too (true, but the timing is sus). I think they didn't realise that she cried because of the betrayal and not because of me pointing it out. But after everyone has scolded me because of the incident, I'm not sure. AITA?

Edit: my sister thinks that her SIL is the AH here but my family thinks that I coloured her opinion and that she thinks that only because of my initial reaction to the Instagram posts.

Edit2: So, I did a little bit of digging these past couple of hours and it looks like SIL has a bit of a narcissistic streak. She wears her own wedding outfit to the weddings of cousins/friends and says it's her personal tradition. Although it's impossible to one-up a South Asian bride, she certainly tries her best at every event. One of the groom's cousins (an old friend by coincidence) also mentioned that she had admitted to her family that she HATES it when people get/have nicer things than her and will always relentlessly try to equal or one-up the situation. This is true because she has been asking my sister the colour of her wedding outfits so that they could ""twin"". She did the same during the engagement party.",,,,,3,,2,3
322,"I (29F) am getting married later this year. We sent out save the dates 2 years ago when we got engaged and now we're about to send out formal invitations. At the time, I sent a StD to a friend. We had been close until then, but the last two years we've barely spoken. There wasn't a falling out, and nothing particularly happened. We both became quite different people, and our views on the world don't align anymore. But in the last year, we've spoken literally once and that was in September 22. I don't really want her to come to the wedding, but I feel like I made a commitment that I ought to keep. Would I be the asshole if I just didn't send her an invitation? Or is it better to invite her, if for no other reason than a reflection of the friendship we did once have?

323,"Back story: me (28m) &amp; my SO (25f) got married a few days ago. The Maid of Honour (MoH) (26f) &amp; Best Man (BM) (40m) are our closest friends, &amp; are in a relationship together. She has a child (3m), who we asked to be ring bearer (RB), from an old relationship, but BM has raised him as his own. MoH disallows photos of RB online, which we understand &amp; respect. MoH is pregnant, and expecting in 2 months.

When my SO asked MoH to be MoH, over a year ago, MoH seemed excited about it all. MoH was left to plan SO’s hen party, with bridesmaids to help. A month before the wedding, one of SO’s cousins, who is a bridesmaid (CO), told SO that MoH has made no plans. Due to panic of a deadline to sort something, CO took over all planning.

Cue argument between SO, MoH, and CO; MoH apologised and promised to step up. SO spoke to MoH and said that if MoH can’t fulfil her roles, due to pregnancy or money, then it’s not an issue; we can help out or, if she wants to, she can step down to bridesmaid or guest.

So fast forward to the hen party, CO has sorted everything and MoH has done nothing. MoH planned on doing a speech at the wedding, but asked CO to do it for her.

Wedding day. BM is very ill but still turns up. MoH and BM are meant to sort some stuff out, but didn’t do anything. BM drinks excessively, making his illness worse. After main course, BM tells me that he’s really ill and thinks he needs to go home. I tell him it’s for the best, as at least he came and spoke to me about it, and I didn’t want anyone else to get sick.

Next thing BM, MoH and RB are outside, so I text BM asking what’s going on, and he replies that they’re all going else RB will play up. No word from MoH, so I text BM asking for MoH to talk to SO. Nothing. So we decide to leave our desserts and go find them. They gave us a cordial goodbye and then left.

Also found out a few days after that MoH messaged our photographers asking for no photos of RB to be posted online (something which they asked us multiple times to sort months ago, which of course we had done). Then we also found out that they spoke to one of the photographers on the day of the wedding, who took a few photos of the three of them, and asked for those photos to be sent directly to them. We had also asked all guests to not post anything to social media before we gave permission, and yet MoH changed her FB photo to a wedding selfie they took straight away.

MoH’s family came up to us after MoH left and apologised for her behaviour. I decided to message MoH and confront her on the issue; but she has been entirely unable to see anything wrong with what she has done. All she keeps on repeating is that it’s HER child, HER right. Which I agree with, but I don’t think that gives her the right to act how she did or to go behind our backs. This makes me question if I should have confronted her.

TL;DR: I feel that MoH let us down &amp; went behind our backs; she thinks she’s done nothing wrong. AITA for confronting her?",,,,,2,,1,2
324,"Simple question: Our sister mailed my brother some marijuana (she grows it herself and the quality is better than anything he can get here). The post office has lost the package.

My brother tried calling customer service but he didn't get anywhere so he went down to the post office in person. They weren't able to help him and now he wants to put in a complaint about our post office for not helping him. I told him he shouldn't but he disagrees with me. He thinks I'm wrong and we've argued about it.

I have worked in customer service my whole life. I hate it when people complain about something that's out of my control or that I didn't do. Don't put in a complaint about me over that situation.

So my mother (F41) is home all day and is a SAH Mom, she watches my one 4 year old Brother and supposedly cleans the house, When me(M15)My sister(F17), and my brother(M16) get home the house is almost always a mess, and she then dumps all her chores on us, she does nothing and sits on her phone doing essentially nothing. For context, my mother is a Recovered Alcoholic who also has very severe ADHD, to the point where she could qualify for disability because of it. She is very disorganized and whenever she does work it's on some minutee job of very low priority, such as vacuuming for extremely long times, sorting through her beach rocks and other miscellaneous tasks while we clean the house. My dad usually gets angry at US because the house is never clean, dinner is never made, and nothing ever gets done. When she was an alcoholic she would borderline abuse us and my infant brother. She did recover and is still a very sweet person but when it comes to tasks and getting things done, she can't really do them, and has sincerely apologized, but she still retains traits from when she was an alcoholic. I finally snapped a bit when she told me that she was going to the BEACH at 6Pm before dinner had been made and told me to clean the whole house. I didnt think it was fair so I told her that it wasn't fair that she was going to give me all of her daily chores after a long day of school.

326,"My ex friend (20) took a generic post I made with no intention to expose anyone and automatically assumed I had malicious intent with it- the storytime I did had no revealing info and did not talk about any personal information in regards to the person I was talking about. They found this post and immediately began to spam my page with personal information about me as a “reaction” to the post. I obviously deleted their comments and blocked them.

Once I did this the person went a step ahead and began to post private messages online and attempt to expose me to random strangers on the internet- claiming that I owed them £100s and basically lying about my life so I could be sl*tshamed on the internet. I had a feeling they would do this so I searched their account to find these posts- attempted to get them to take down said posts and it resulted in a bigger argument which led to them telling me to go d*e.

Frustrated- I find their Facebook account and contact their family in hopes of being able to speak directly to my ex friends parents as I believe it went too far. Ex friend was informed and called me crying on the phone saying that I ruined their life and started trauma dumping on me and tried to get me to claim ownership of their account so they could avoid being held accountable for creating malicious posts about me online. They also cried about how they would be kicked out when prior to this situation they mocked me getting kicked out of the house by my mother and expected me to feel any ounce of sympathy for a situation that they weren’t even aware of about me. I ended the call and blocked their number.

A few minutes later, ex friend posts online AGAIN and claims that I outed their sexuality to their family and now they are in danger- now everyone is on their side because outing of sexuality is very sensitive and I feel horrible for contacting their parents. I know for a fact that the screenshots of their account I sent to their family was only of malicious comments they posted about me and nothing in relation to sexuality- if their parents went through their account I’m surely not to blame for being outed right?

327,"Hello there. I've been with my husband for 12 years now but we've been together for 15 years in total.

In April, my husband left his Manhattan-based job because it was too work-from-home focused and he had no guarantee he could return to the office from the employer. He said working from home didn't work for him. It wasn't explicitly a fuck-you, but him sticking to his principles. Since then, he's been trying to look for work, but didn't get to interview stages with some employers.

He did tell me he had to go to Las Vegas for an interview, so I helped him last month look for cheap flights and get ready, he said he'd applied for a job in a casino (what it was, I forgot). He went, and said it went well, but didn't hear anything back from them...

Until last Friday, when he's announced he's got the job in the casino.

If anything, I'd expected him to get the job in New Brunswick he applied for - a position that couldn't be done as WFH (it involved driving a Chevy Express van).

He's not a croupier or anything like that, his role's more behind-the-scenes at a smaller, more obscure casino on the city limits of Las Vegas. It's a tourist attraction but overshadowed by the giant casinos. IIRC, it's tribal-owned but not on a tribal reservation, close to a fast food joint, so my husband tells me.

Anyway, if I'm being honest here, I'm not sure I WANT to move to Las Vegas.

I've worked for 16 years with adults who have autism spectrum disorder (before that was a waitress in a Mexican restaurant) and am now a social worker (not in a group home or day center); I've been one for the past 9 years. I'm self-employed.

I'm worried I won't be able to find work in my career in Las Vegas. Currently I'm licensed only here in New Jersey (the part bordering Manhattan); we live near New Brunswick.

I want to continue what I do, not get a job in fast food or service job, my job is an essential job in many ways and I like what I do. Being my own boss is hard but rewarding.

My job is rewarding, but hard work at times, and obviously can't be done from home. FWIW, some of the people involved don't even understand what Zoom is or use it so doing remote work isn't possible. I couldn't work during the pandemic when people were suggesting working from home. My job REQUIRED in-person contact.

I've told my husband we need to have a ""big talk"" about the realities of life in Las Vegas and how hard it'll be for me to find a job, but was pleased about the fact he'd applied for a job and refused to give up in these challenging times and stuck to his principles.

If anything, won't Las Vegas be a culture shock to two New Jerseyans like ourselves?

I worry about two things; finding a job and not fitting in culturally with the locals (IIRC, parts of my state are considered culturally similar to Southern states).

AITA here, or is this a case of ESH?

I expect I may get a judgment I don't like, but I am asking for honest, open advice.

I asked him for a favor and he said to me, “I ain’t doing shit for you because you’re a shitty ass friend, you don’t deserve nothing from me” 
And I was really confused so I asked him why he was so upset and he replied 
“Because you yelled at me and treated me like shit a bunch of times and you did this song talking shit about your ex’s (17f) new boyfriend”
(btw in the song I did I added a part saying “I’m sorry to both of you, I just feel confused, I don’t know what I’m saying”)

Yes, I yelled at him, and I apologized to him, but, why I did those things? 

1.he was drunk one time whining about my ex gf(17f) for not being with him instead, I told him to stop being so fucking ridiculous and that was one of the few times I kinda treated him like shit while he was sad at that time

2.he accused me of being the one behind a fake account with my name that was used to text my exes and other girls a bunch of times even tho I proved him I’m not the one behind that account 

3.he convinced my ex(17f) that I’m a cheater because of the fake account and after that he slept with her while we were dating as revenge for being a cheater(which I’m not)

4.he kept number 2 as a secret from me

After everything he did to me I forgave him, but I was different with him, I wasn’t that nice like before all that, I was way more heavy whenever he felt sad telling him stuff like “stop crying over stupid things and be a man” 

I did a lot for him, I forgave him a lot of things, I helped him get back his relationship with his ex, I was there every time he felt sad, even cried for him, etc

My roommate and I leave our shoes next to the front door and his puppy recently started chewing on only my shoes. When I brought this up last week, he stated that I should just ""put my shoes in my room"", which I feel is bad dog ownership. Why should I change my habits for your dog?

334,"I feel like I’m in the wrong sub for this, but my sister has an alcohol problem, and I’m scared to get her help because I feel like she’ll spill my secrets. 

I used to drink and consume other stuff with her but I took a step back and stopped. And now that she’s taken things too far I have no idea how to let her know that it’s wrong, or that I’m not happy with what’s she’s doing.

Our relationship is different. Even though I’m the older one, we’ve never had the “stern older sibling” thing. We were more like friends honestly and I never bosses her around (or maybe she never listened?), i never shouted at her, I’ve never called her out, and I’ve never pulled the older sister card ever really. I was more like the really close best friend who would give her advice but she’d never take it. 

The main issue is that our parents don’t know that I used to drink, like ever. They don’t know that I’ve ever even touched drugs. I’ve never been caught and they have no reason to suspect it. I just can’t imagine my parents finding out. And if my sister knew that I raised some concerns with them or any one else, she’d immediately let them know of my past. Because to her I’m tattling, not helping her. 

So now every-time we talk and she mentions how the family is angry at her because she came home drunk last night (every day) I do nothing but nod and hum and agree with her delusional reasons and take her side. 

I cant bring myself to get involved or exposed. So I just keep quiet and let her make dumb decisions so … AITA?",,,,,1,,2,4
335,"My mom and dad's birthdays are days apart. I live in another province from them so when their birthdays come, I usually just do video calls via FB messenger. My mom's birthday comes first and on the day, I tried calling her the first thing in the morning. She didn't answer which I thought was weird since she is an early bird. Later that evening, I called again and she answered. She didn't seem happy and I asked what the celebration plans are and she said that there's nothing planned and she's too busy baking cakes for her business. I knew something was wrong at that point so I called my brother who lives nearby my parents after the call with my mom. I found out that my mom doesn't have anything planned because they're trying to minimize expenses. When I asked why, my brother said that all of their money was spent into paying another one of my father's debts. Yes, another one - for a more than a decade old 2nd hand SUV... which they didn't need because they still have a fully functioning vehicle. I got sad and mad at the same time; sad for my mom who doesn't get to at least have a nice dinner or cake on her birthday and she deserves better, and mad at my father because he's doing it again with this surprise ""purchases"" which he is unable to pay for.

I asked my wife if I can take a bit from what I was supposed to put into our savings so that I can give some money to my brother so that they can have a surprise dinner, even if it's a day after my mom's birthday. My brother agreed to arrange the party and apologized that he can't pitch in since our father also borrowed all the extra cash he had left, which is also the same situation with our youngest sibling.

The next day, the surprise party pushed through. They had dinner and cake at a restaurant and mom was teary-eyed-happy. As long as she's happy, that's all that matters to me.

A week after, father's birthday came and I sent him a greeting by text since he doesn't have any active IM account,  to which I got a thank you reply with a smiley.  I asked my brother if they had plans for father's birthday, to which unsurprisingly the answer is a resounding ""NO"". ""Can't do bro - no monnies."", which I understand completely. I didn't bother to check about the ""celebration"", or rather the lack thereof the rest of the day.

A few days after, I got a message from my aunt saying that father was heartbroken that we didn't bother to give him a celebration for his birthday, despite having one for mother. I did explain to her why and that the TLDR is the lack of funds and the fact that he basically drained my mom's bank account and wallet to pay for a debt of a purchase of an item that he didn't ""need"" and wasn't discussed to our mom prior.

336,"So just as the title reads, I had a “friend” (I would consider us a weird inbetween of friends and acquaintances) get married recently. I went to highschool with her and her fiancé but never talked with her much then. She reached out to me months ago about altering her wedding gown for her. I was super flattered that she asked and I of course agreed. I worked with her for months on this dress. This was an especially difficult job because she broke her ankle about 2 months before her wedding. I tried to be as accommodating as I could because of this. I agreed to fittings at her house despite it being such a difficult environment to work in ( lots of pets, people and not the cleanest carpets). I did her bridal alterations at an extremely discounted rate. She referred me to others in her wedding party as well. I really appreciated the business. 

I figured out i had double booked myself 5/5(her wedding day) about 2 weeks before her wedding but was unsure how to approached this with her. A week before her wedding I got an injury but still dropped off clothing to her. Come the day of the wedding I couldn’t make it because of a vacation plan I had made prior and I felt horrible about it. I texted her today, Sunday, and apologized for not being able to come but still told her I have a gift for her and her husband. She left me on read… AITA and should I still drop the gift off to her? It is an embroidery I made using scraps from her and her peoples clothes commemorating the wedding.",,,,,2,,2,3
337,"I went to prom with my sister and her friends. one of my friends (we’ll call Jen) went to prom so I asked if I could hang with her. She has a boyfriend. I told her I don’t want to third wheel. She said she was going with a group so it’s fine and that I wouldn’t third wheel. 

Prom night, and I’m hanging with my sister and her friends for a bit. Jen and her group arrive and I go and greet them. I shake the bf hand as I know him (not enough to say we’re friends but we’re cool) I say hey to Jen and we make our way to the back. I only talked to Jen and her bf as they were the only people I knew. Jen talked to me a lot thru the night and we cracked jokes and jus talked. I kept feeling like her bf was subtly pushing me to the outskirts of the group and would stand between me and Jen at times. I I blew it off. If he feels like I’m third wheeling I’ll give them the space. Everytime he’d try to be I guess romantical she would just make a face and laugh it off. 

night continued, slow songs come on and I stepped back to let the couples dance as I’m lonely. They start slow dancing for a bit while I sit on my phone. Jen suggests we make a circle and all dance together and goes to grab my hand to include me. He intercepts the hand and grabs mine instead. He grabs another guys hand and us three dance. We all laughed and kept it going but it felt like he didn’t want me to touch her at all. I blew it off because if he doesn’t want me to then it is what it is.

As me and Jen talk, he continues to subtly push himself between me and her. I made sure not to stand too close to her as I didn’t want to seem like I’m stealing her from him. When he slid between us I’d do something else. He eventually told her we should get some drinks and grabbed her hand and walked off quickly. She turned to wave me over but at that point I took the hint. He didn’t want me hanging with his gf. he walked off very quick and didn’t look back. I told her I’d hang back. 

I went back to hanging with my sister and her friends and Jen texted me immediately saying how she’s sorry they left so quick. I was hanging with my sisters group so I don’t see the text. She rushes up to me and says she leaving and to get home safe and she’ll see me at school. I dab her up and she runs back to her group. As they are walking out, she waves bye, I notice that her bf doesn’t even glance in my direction. 

At the beginning of the dance he would talk and joke with me but by the end it almost seemed like he was sick of my presence. I felt weird but didn’t say anything to Jen as it’s not my place. I could’ve been third wheeling but If I was Jen would’ve said something but she seemed to like talking to me and was including me in everything. I thought maybe he thinks I was trying to make a move on his gf. I wasn’t. We’re friends. I’d never try to break them up and I doubt she likes me. All we did was joke and talk. It didn’t seem like she was trying to hit on me so I don’t see any problem.

338,"A little backstory me and my older brother have this box filled with lehos from the 90s and 2000s . It qas originally his but he passed it doen to me when I was a child. We both spent good years playing with it alone and with friends while growing up and never had the intention of selling it or giving it away.I also would like to add that the items were mostly purchased by my beloved grandmother (who passed a few years ago) and the items are something that me and my brother cherish and have as a shared  sentimental item.Now to the main point,my father invited some of our well known family friends (2 parents and 1 child that's around 4-5) They don't come to our house often and when they do it's always nice spending time with them , the issue isn't them tho. We were getting stuff ready for dinner and I wasn't going to join them since I had plans with friends(everyone was aware and ok with it) The child ig was getting bored cuz my dad brought out the lego box (without my knowledge ) and At first I was like "" ok that's fine, he'll just play with it and then we'll put it back"" that did not indeed happen. My father instead , gave it away to the child without asking me or my brother or anyone for that matter and I know for a fact that the child will play with it for 2 days tops since it has a lot 9f toys at home .I mean I would've given it to some kid one day but only if it was on my and my brothers terms.  We're still grieving and these toys as stupid as it sounds help us remember the good times. Anyway when I found out days later (not from my dad btw but my mom) I got furious and started yelling at him and just lashing out . I'd also like to mention that my brother hasn't found out yet (he lives abroad so there's no way he'd know) I was going to tell him but my mother advised against it since he'd get very upset and it wouldn't end well.

339,"My husband and I have been having some financial arguments lately. We have been together for four years and we have shared bank accounts.

For background: My husband used to be a successful entrepreneur in our home province, making well over $150,000K a year. He had access to multiple lines of credit. He used to use these lines of credit to purchase ""toys"", like snowmobiles, boats, and motorcycles, which he would enjoy for a season or two, and sell them for a profit. He gave up his portion of the business to his family (didn't sell it), and moved to a new province with me for my medical residency. He has liquidated a portion of his assets (ex. toys that he was no longer using, like an airplane and motorcycles), which resulted in an extra $20K for us to spend on living expenses. We agreed at that time that it should be allocated for our living expenses, and once we were in a good financial position later on in life, he could use the $20K to purchase some toys back.

For the first year and a half of my residency, he was not working.  Unfortunately he developed depression and alcoholism, and decided that he needed to work again. A few months ago he started working at a job that pays $110K a year.

I am finishing my medical residency in Family Medicine. Through medical school, I accrued $130K in debt. I currently make $60k a year. I will graduate in two months, and my income will be around $300K/year.

Because my husband has only worked for a few months of the last year, and I only make $60K a year, we are still in a lot of debt. Our monthly net income is about $10K, and $1500 is allocated towards each person for a ""fun fund,"" in which we can spend the money on whatever we want. He currently has $3000 left over in his fun fund, which has been saved up from the previous few months.

He is currently eyeing up a motorcycle that is about $7K in price, which is more than double of what he has left in his fun fund. He does not have a plan on how he will obtain the extra $4K. He says that the money he got from liquidating his old toys ($20K), should be potentially returned to him. The only source of extra money we have is my medical line of credit, but I would like to pay that down instead. Furthermore, we have to purchase a new vehicle as one of our vehicles broke down, which will be $15K. We also purchased him a new e-mountain bike a few months ago, which was $10K. We are also hoping to save for a down payment on a house in this new province, which will be about $150-200K. He also has two other motorcycles which he doesn't ride.

When he asked for my permission for him to buy the motorcycle, I asked him how he would find the extra funds. He said that he would ""figure it out"" as he ""always did in the past."" He then became very angry with me, and accused me of being non-supportive. He says that he feels ""trapped"" because he will never be like his old self - the spontaneous, risk taking, entrepreneur. We have been in a fight the entire weekend. I am exhausted.",,,,,1,,1,None
340,"So I [21M] live at home and my parents and I don’t get along at all. As soon as I finish college I am out of there and never speaking to them again. Yes, its that bad. 

Recently I bought a collection of T-shirts online. All of them say a city, when the city was established, and what state it’s in respectively. I got a bunch of different cities and a bunch of different colors. 

I was so excited when they came in the mail today and when my mom saw them, she told me that they’re very generic T-shirts and that I shouldn’t have spent my money on such stupid shirts. 

I’m not sure why when she has a lot of clothing, but my mom always wears the same clothes and it’s very rare to see her even change shirts, so I told her entire wardrobe is trash especially the outfit she wears most. 

I didn’t expect it to happen but she went in her bedroom and cried? 

Like I said before I don’t like her so normally I wouldn’t care to make her upset but for some reason seeing her cry made me feel guilty. Not guilty enough to apologize but guilty. 

I told my sister who doesn’t live at home about it and she told me it was unnecessary and I should have just let it be instead of hurting her feelings; making a strike for her entire wardrobe when she just said she didn’t like my collection of shirts. 

But I can’t stand my mom’s condescending attitude so shutting her down was necessary.

341,"My sister has been having a hard time with her kids lately. She's been stressed and she's frustrated that no relatives are spending time with her kids more (or babysitting them) for her. 

Here's the thing: I do spend time with her kids. I see them probably about once a month or once every couple of months. I live 2+ hours away and visiting costs a lot on gas and time, and I'm incredibly busy as a senior in college with a part time job. I spent almost every weekend with her firstborn, but I haven't had near the free time recently. And honestly, I don't even want to. My family (mostly mom and dad but sister too) has a history of being toxic and stressful, so visits end in tears more often than not. I visit for holidays and other occasions but lately I've been avoiding the whole ordeal more for my own mental health.

I love my neices, dont get me wrong. I adore them. But I hate that she's acting like I have some kind of obligation to spend MORE time with them when I feel like I spend a normal amount considering how far away I live and how hard it is to travel in and out of Seattle where she lives. I don't have cash to burn on gas every other weekend, or the energy to spare babysitting her 2 yr old and 4 month old.

So I guess, basically, am I the a hole for not spending more time with her kids in spite of how much it stresses me out?

Update: I took some of your guys' advice and set a boundary. I told we might be able to aim for once a month visit-wise but I don't think its fair that she expects so much from me/is implying I'm a bad relative for not going out of my way. I'll let you know what she says tomorrow.

Update 2: A rare happy ending for this sub! My sister and I had a long talk and she realized how she was coming across/how demanding it was. Shes been stressed and was in a vulnerable place when she said everything before. We got to the heart of it and we agreed on doing video calls more often, since driving down is so difficult. At the end she actually DID just want to see me more/have me more involved with the kiddos, she just ended up venting some frustration my way. Yay communication lol",,,,,1,,1,None
342,"I A 15(F) Utterly stupid student, has managed to figure out my mom is eating edibles. I was looking for something in her room and found a bag stinking of weed, and full of packing of Mary jane lolipops. I have been utterly disgusted &amp; distort. Normally i could care less about some one doing drugs, But since it was my mother (A God believing, almost stroypical Mexican, &amp; a little homophobic woman), It was quite shocking, there are lots of moments where i have said jokes about getting high that have gotten me punished or yelled at, &amp; like i said i honestly or used to not care if people smoked, ate or did anything with weed before, unless if my mother or family brought it up, like hemp lotion, lol i’m not sure why im apposed to the the idea. My mother and father always make me go to church everyday for bible study, but as of late they have just seen it as free rides to school, (Ps. I do not believe in god, but my parents do or used to.) , This event is also a month or 2 after i found out my aunt also does edibles , i was not as surprised as i found put from my mother, But to be fair stuff like this is expected from her(my aunt). Honestly after this whole situation i feel as if my mother has been different since a also a month or two ago, she seems more indifferent to me and my younger sister(9), After she had changed her job shift, She also seemed to make more friends, Leading me to a theory that a new friend of hers introduced her to these, I have also considered the fact that me and my sister have been shit heads though, I really want to understand why, but honestly horrified to what the answer is, i love my mother truely, but i have started to see her in a indifferent light, i feel disgusted and unclean around her, I can’t believe the same woman who gaslight me into saying my anxiety was fake so “i don’t get pills” is now using edibles as a reliever, i have cried all day, i try to forget but its so hard too its just engraved into my mind. Tonight i was proven right seeing my mom being blood shot coughing, i hope this arnt symptoms but turns out they might be. Honestly all i want to do is throw away those stupid gummiest, But i wont, if this makes her happy she can keep them, Also a nother thing i fear if that shes giving these to my father. Honestly all i Can hope is their doing this because of me and not some influence.

I dont know what to do i know edibles don’t hurt you, but so far its hurting me just keeping this secret! I know i seem like a spoiled rat but i just can’t, ive never seen her do stuff like this infact she and he (my parents) made a point to say those were horrible, even getting hit on the side of the head for making a joke about it while back.

Please i need to know what to do, and would i be the asshole, or if i am the asshole.

edit: my mother and father work for a navy own property, father works for the gov, all though not illegal where i live but they could both seriously get fired for using if caught, they will do drug testing if they suspect something, also how long does weed take to clear up your system?, And yes i know that im overreacting but i’m worried about how this can impact my family my sister, situation and maybe my father if he doesn’t know about this.",,,,,2,,1,None
343,"Hey guys, I need some judgment on whether or not I'm an asshole for not inviting my vegetarian friend to my BBQ party. So, I planned this party for this weekend and I invited all of my friends, except for my vegetarian friend, let's call her Jane. 

The reason I didn't invite Jane is because she's a vegetarian, and I'm planning on grilling up some meat for the party. I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable or left out, so I just didn't invite her. 

When Jane found out about the party through social media, she was really upset with me and said that I was being inconsiderate of her beliefs. But I think it's ridiculous that I should have to cater to her dietary restrictions, especially since I'm the one hosting the party. 

So, am I the asshole for not inviting my vegetarian friend to my BBQ party? I just don't think it's fair that I should have to change my plans to accommodate her diet.

Thanks for your feedback in advance!

Edit: some people have pointed out that I could just provide vegetarian options for Jane, but I don't think it's my responsibility to do so. And now that I tried to invite her, and I said she could come and bring her own vegan food, she said she doesn't even want to come anymore.",,,,,3,,3,3

She was awful to me and my older brother, forced our family to move house since ours was too small and then complained when the house we moved in was also too small. Reason being was because every house she and my dad looked at she didn’t like. She got pregnant with my half sister back in 2011 and ever since she was born, it was as if me and my older brother never existed. I was always blamed for stuff that she did, my dad forced me to let her be in my room 24/7 and she made my life hell.

345,"The first day this guy moves in , he parks his truck directly in front of my mailbox , even though there is room in his driveway and in the street parking in front of his house. There is a tree and a flowerbed outlined with rocks showing where the properties are landmarked. I went to check my mailbox passive aggressively hoping he would notice , he did and said he could move the truck if I need to , flabbergasted by the sheer lack of awareness and consideration and being the first time this happened, I threw my hands in the air , didn't say a word and walked inside my house. He moved the truck . 

Lady Friday, I notice his woman's car (she drives a black suv) parked just in front of the mailbox,  a whole maybe 6 feet in front of the tree and flowerbed outlined by rocks, maybe 3 feet from the mailbox , so much so , a mailman would not be able to deliver mail, and my landscapers would have to park cut where the car is parked. Mind you, it is illegal to park on our street , it is a narrow country road. Also , it bothers me that they are not staying on their side and taking a parking spot that is on my side and infront of my house should I need it. Also, there was enough parking for one car in their driveway, and two cars in front of their side of the duplex unit, on the street parking in front of their ""house"".  I leaned towards not saying anything,  but my fiance convinced me I needed to say something and even offered herself to say something,  so not trusting her to speak carefully , I volunteered myself for the duty. 

I went over to the house , and his truck pulls up when I had originally planned on asking whoever was in the house , being their was also an unfamiliar white car parked in the driveway.  He stepped out of the truck , I shook his hand and introduced myself , him being relatively new ; we had not spoken yet. I then explained to him:""sometimes my landscapers go in there(pointing at the spot in front of my house , literally in front of my big front window on the second story of my home , clearly across the obvious tree and flowerbed outlined by rocks that my landscapers cut all the time) and asked him : ""can you move the car please?"" 
He then said yeah , walking back to his 1 car garage in his twin ranch style duplex , ""she was just cleaning for a second , don't worry about it."" So I said ok thank you . Then he goes into his garage and I hear him scream ""it's just a car, oh lord!"" Or something incredulous like this.

GFs mom said she had been trying to sell it for 3K, which when I checked KBB was way over the listing for a used 2007 Versa. But, because we were in a pickle she offered to sell it to us for 1.5K, she told us it ran great, A/C worked great, the only thing wrong with it was the driver window didnt roll down and it needed a new battery, which she would buy. (we ended up having to buy it)

We had been making payments to her, 200$ a paycheck, real easy like. First off, we noticed a few things: Both windows in the front did not roll down, AC.. does not work. CD player.. does not work. speaker is completely blown. OK whatever, it was January so we didnt need AC yet. But then, about two weeks after buying it, it started dying. took it in and found out the fuel pump was dead. 1400$ to fix the fuel pump.

Ive fixed the fuel pump, I put two new windows in myself, new drivers side speaker.. ive spent maybe close to 1,500$ fixing this car.. I want to give it to my girlfriend when we get another vehicle

so far we've payed 900$ towards the car, and I feel for the car I actually got, this is more than enough. She said she was going to get it checked out before she sold it to us, she didnt. she told us all it needed was a battery and it would run great. it didnt. am I the asshole for not wanting to pay the remaining 600$, after ive spent close to 1,500$ getting the car working again?",,,,,1,,1,2

It’s important to me that they get to know the family, language and culture of their second country. They’re now almost 6 and 2.5 years old.
